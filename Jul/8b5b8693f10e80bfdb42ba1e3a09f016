Vodacom has collaborated with Google to launch Google Play Store bundles for Android smartphone subscribers. Customers can browse, download and update their favourite apps from the Google Play Store, without any additional data costs. Vodacom Group digital and fixed officer, Zunaid Mahomed, said: “Vodacom prides itself on being a leading digital telco that strives to offer innovative services, solutions and continuous value for all our customers. We’re extremely proud to be the first telco in the world to offer Google Play Store bundles, enabling our customers to connect to the apps they love on the Google Play Store on the Vodacom network. “As we continue our pricing transformation journey, we have set our sights on reducing the barriers to access the Google Play Store by introducing bundles that will simplify the process for consumers and translate to savings in data spend in the process. Our goal is to play an active role in enabling customers to fully optimise their smartphone use and connect today for a better tomorrow.” Vodacom said that customers will save on data costs linked to updating or downloading the latest apps, as the bundle prices have been reduced. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-417229" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vodacom.png" alt="" width="744" height="127" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vodacom.png 744w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Vodacom-300x51.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Vodacom appoints interim chief financial officer
