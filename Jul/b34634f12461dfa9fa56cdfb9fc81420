Gauteng has hit the critical milestone of 40,000 coronavirus cases, with the province counting 42,881 cases at latest reporting. Total recoveries in the province now sit at 10,534, while deaths having risen to 216. A total of 2,981 people are currently hospitalised in either public or private facilities. In a statement on Sunday evening (28 June), Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said that the entire country is likely to see an increase in cases, but it will be economic hubs which will be hardest hit. He added that in coming days, Gauteng will emerge as the province with the highest Covid-19 numbers. Mkhize said that the factors contributing to this trend are: Inward migration;
The large population (especially in metros like Johannesburg, Ekurhuleni and Tshwane);
Increased congregating which spurs cluster outbreaks;
The level to which people are able to adapt to new behaviours such as social distancing and the wearing of masks. The provincial government has indicated that the province could see a stricter lockdown imposed as infections surge. However, Mkhize noted that no discussions have taken place at a national level as of yet. “There has not been any decision taken (to have another hard lockdown) and certainly the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) does not take lightly a decision of that nature,” he said in an interview on Tuesday. “There may be need in some areas for restrictions, it may not be national but localised. But no such decision has been taken as yet. “One of the challenges with Gauteng is the fact that you have different metropolitan areas which is one ecosystem. As we move into the future we need to be open minded as to what our needs are.” The below table details the cases per district in more detail.
