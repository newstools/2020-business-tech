ASUS has launched its new ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 in South Africa, aimed at serious gamers, streamers, and professional creators. The ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 sports a unique dual-display design integrated into an ultra-slim form factor that delivers exceptional versatility and utility. This laptop boasts a 15.6-inch 4K G-Sync primary display and a 14.1-inch 4K ScreenPad Plus – which is secondary touchscreen that sits above the RGB keyboard. Despite having two displays and the latest in high-end hardware inside, the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 is only 21mm thick and remains cool and quiet during use. This is made possible by the device’s elegant Active Aerodynamic System (AAS) Plus design, which sees the full-width ROG ScreenPad Plus lifting up from the base of the laptop when open, allowing for better cooling and improved viewing angles for the secondary display. “With AAS Plus, tilting the touchscreen at an angle opens a larger 28.5 mm air intake, and allows the fans to draw in cooler air from above the laptop instead of warmer air from beneath it,” ASUS said. “This massive air intake increases airflow by up to 30% over previous AAS implementations, improving performance, and putting less strain on the internal cooling system.” ASUS has also put a lot of work into the quality of the device’s displays. The main 4K UHD panel boasts extremely high pixel density, supports G-Sync, is Pantone-validated to guarantee colour accuracy, and also supports 100% of the Adobe RGB colour space. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 is a powerful and impressive laptop, offering the best hardware on the market. This includes an Intel Core i9-10980HK octa-core CPU with a clock speed of up to 5.3GHz. The laptop is also equipped with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 2080 Super graphics card, which can hit peak clock speeds of 1,330MHz in Turbo mode and boasts 8GB of GDDR6 VRAM. In terms of storage and memory, the ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 continues to offer excellent specifications. “With up to 48GB of combined onboard and SO-DIMM memory, Zephyrus Duo 15 is ready for multitasking mastery across multiple displays,” ASUS said. “Two nimble NVM Express PCIe x4 SSDs run in RAID 0 to provide plenty of high-speed storage,” it added. “The dual-drive array makes the whole system feel more responsive, with lightning load times and quick access to data,” he said. Furthermore, the laptop’s touchpad, which is tucked neatly to the right of the keyboard, lights up a digital numeric keypad with the press of a button. Other impressive features include a Thunderbolt 3 port with support for power delivery, Wi-Fi 6 connectivity, and a premium ESS Sabre DAC for next-level audio. The ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 will be available in South Africa from 30 July 2020 and will be priced at R89,999. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420912" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-1.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 1" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-1.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-1-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420916" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-3.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 3" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-3.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-3-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420918" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-4.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 4" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-4.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-4-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420920" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-5.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 5" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-5.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-5-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-420922" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-6.jpg" alt="ASUS ROG Zephyrus Duo 15 6" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-6.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/ASUS-ROG-Zephyrus-Duo-15-6-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This article was published in partnership with ASUS.
