The Department of Transport has published a new directive outlining the new validity periods for licences in South Africa. While the country’s licencing centres have been open for several months, services have been greatly impacted as a growing number of employees test positive for Covid-19 and centres are forced to close. To address these issues, the department has extended the validity period for some expired licences until the start of 2021. These dates are outlined in more detail below. 31 August 2020 –  All motor vehicle licence discs, temporary permits and roadworthy certificates that expired during the period that commenced from 26 March 2020 up to and including 31 May 2020 are deemed to be valid and their validity period is extended for a further grace period ending on 31 August 2020; 30 November 2020 – Motor trade number licences that expired during the period that commenced from 26 March 2020 up to and including 31 May 2020 are deemed to be valid and are extended for a further grace period ending on 30 November 2020; 31 January 2021 –  All learner’s licences, driving licence cards, temporary driving licences and professional driving permits that expire during the period that commenced from 26 March 2020 up to and including 31 August 2020 are deemed to be valid and their validity period is extended for a further grace period ending on 31 January 2021. It should be noted that motorists visiting licencing centres should follow the gazetted health and safety guidelines. These include: Covid-19 screening at the entrances;
Limited number of customers allowed in at a time;
Social distancing is required and must be adhered to;
Limited daily transactions, please visit early in the day. Ticket numbers are issued and if a service limit is reached for the day, bring the same ticket number with you the next day if possible;
Longer queues due to reduced staff;
Only your ID is needed for motor vehicle licensing and registration renewals. You can read the full directive below.  Read: How to avoid vehicle repossession when times are tough
