Minister of Public Works and Infrastructure, Patricia de Lille, says that government plans to build more than 50 special infrastructure projects to boost jobs in the country. Presenting on the plans on Monday (27 July), De Lille said that infrastructure-led economic growth is the most effective and significant parts of government’s economic growth strategy to grow our economy while at the same time respond to the Socio-Economic needs of our people. This aligns with comments made by president Cyril Ramaphosa, who said that infrastructure development will form a key part of South Africa’s economic response to the coronavirus pandemic. “The severe economic recession, together with the Covid-19 pandemic, has now placed an added urgency on us to navigate a new normal,” De Lille said “In this new normal, there is an even greater need to partner in the investment and implementation of infrastructure that will facilitate social and economic growth in a workable and purposeful way. “In South Africa, infrastructure investment, together with the use of public land and public buildings, is a critical lever to achieve spatial and economic justice by connecting our people, integrating our communities and bringing people closer to work opportunities.” De Lille said that the first 50 projects of the programme and an additional 12 Special Projects were gazetted on Friday 24 July 2020 as Strategic Integrated Projects (SIPs) in terms of the Infrastructure Development Act. <img class="size-full wp-image-420105 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GCIS-2.jpg" alt="" width="940" height="788" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GCIS-2.jpg 940w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GCIS-2-300x251.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/GCIS-2-768x644.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> She broke down these developments in more detail below.
