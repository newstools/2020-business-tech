Power utility, Eskom says it will implement stage 2 load shedding on Monday 13 July, with next week’s outlook remaining bleak. The utility said despite its best efforts to return additional generation units to service following a number of breakdowns that occurred during the past week, it has not made sufficient progress to suspend load shedding, which began Friday. “Implementing load shedding tomorrow is also necessary in order to replenish the emergency generation reserves to better prepare for the week,” it said. “Eskom wishes to assure the public that implementing load-shedding is the last resort, in order to protect the national grid.”  Stage 2 load-shedding will be suspended at 22:00 on Sunday evening, and then resumes at 09:00 on Monday. This, it said, will limit he impact of load shedding on the morning traffic peak. “Last night after peak demand period, Eskom successfully, returned one unit at the Kriel power station, adding 475MW to the grid. The return of generation unit each at Tutuka and Kriel power stations has been delayed, contributing to the supply constraints,” it said. During the coming week, Eskom will continue to experience supply constraints, it said. “Due to much colder weather, demand for electricity has risen significantly.” Read: Eskom chief operating officer breached policy on contract, sought job for relative
