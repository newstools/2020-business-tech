BusinessTech’s growth over 2019 and the start of 2020 has been impressive, but its audiences numbers truly took off when the Covid-19 pandemic hit. BusinessTech’s South African audience has grown from just over 3 million readers in May 2019 to over 8 million readers in June 2020 – evidence of its popularity. “With people and companies taking a digital-first approach to work and life, we see online news sites remaining the go-to choice for South Africans looking for the latest, accurate information,” said Lancaster. “We expect readership for online news sites to remain strong going forward, and we have seen more companies increasing their digital marketing spend to ensure they reach their target audiences where they spend most of their time: online.” To find out more about advertising on BusinessTech, please contact Kevin Lancaster on kevin@businesstech.co.za This article was published in partnership with BusinessTech.
