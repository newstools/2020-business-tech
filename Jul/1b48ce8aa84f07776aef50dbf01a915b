The symptoms experienced in the first few days of a Covid-19 infection could help predict the course a patient’s illness will follow. That’s one of the initial conclusions from a team of researchers from King’s College London in the UK. Their research has identified six possible sub-divisions of Covid-19, using machine learning to analyse data from a symptom-tracking app. These findings – from a pre-print paper not yet peer-reviewed – reflect how the thinking regarding the disease is evolving and how technologies are being leveraged to fight the disease.
