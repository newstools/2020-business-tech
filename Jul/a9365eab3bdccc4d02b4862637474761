Chris Labuschagne, chief executive of FNB Credit Card, said that the card also includes a number of safety features. “One of the key security features on our virtual card is a dynamic Card Verification Value (CVV) security number that changes every hour to help customers minimise the risk of fraud when shopping online. “The virtual card will be safely stored on the app and customers will have the ability to temporarily block, cancel or replace the card via our app.” Labuschagne said that encryption and security features may prompt customers to authenticate a transaction on the app to reduce reliance on OTPs which make customers vulnerable to fraud. He added that spending via virtual cards will provide customers with the eBucks rewards. “Additionally, the virtual card can be uploaded and used on various online subscription platforms such as iTunes, Google play store, Netflix, Spotify and more. “The expiry date is also longer than a physical card which allows the customer to keep using the card without being worried about an expiry period,” said Labuschagne.
