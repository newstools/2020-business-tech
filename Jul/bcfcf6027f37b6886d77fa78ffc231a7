Pick n Pay says that is making changes to how personal discounts on its Smart Shopper programme work, starting 14 July. The retailer said that from 14 July it will automatically load personalised discounts directly onto a customer’s loyalty card – a move that is expected to help more customers save more on their grocery shopping, it said. Using advanced machine learning techniques, Pick n Pay said it offers each Smart Shopper eight personalised discounts every two weeks. These are unique to each customer and offer cash-off savings, discounts or boosted points for products they buy most often, it said. “This algorithm predicts what a customer is likely to buy and helps us work in conjunction with our partners to give customers personalised savings on the items they want or plan to buy,” said John Bradshaw, retail executive: marketing at Pick n Pay. To receive these discounts, customers will need to ensure they have given permission to be contacted – this can be done via the app, Pick n Pay’s website, or in-store at a kiosk. When personalised discounts are automated in July, Smart Shoppers who have opted in for communication will see the discounts automatically applied and visible on their till slip when they swipe their card. “All Smart Shoppers are earning and spending their points but many weren’t reaping the full rewards of the programme by not regularly loading the personalised discounts,” said Bradshaw. “This improvement will instantly help put money back in customer’s pockets at a time when budgets are under pressure.” Read: South Africa’s largest private-sector employer is offering IT and data science bursaries
