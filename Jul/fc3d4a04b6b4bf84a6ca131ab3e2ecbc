Government has reintroduced an evening curfew in South Africa as part of a number of new restrictions aimed at curbing the surge of coronavirus cases in the country. In a national address on Sunday evening (12 July), President Cyril Ramaphosa said that the curfew will be implemented between 21h00 and 04h00 daily. The curfew comes into effect from 21h00 on Monday evening (13 July) and does not have a set end date. According to an accompanying directive published by minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, South Africans will require a permit should they need to travel during these prohibited times. These permits are required for people who perform essential or other permitted services and require both the employee’s information and the information of the company. The below form shows what the permit looks like.

He noted that the country has reported a total of 260,242 confirmed cases, with more than 12,000 new cases being reported every day. This means that there are effectively 500 new cases being reported every hour. “The coronavirus storm is far fiercer and more destructive than any we have known before. It is stretching our resources and our resolve to their limits,” he said. “The surge of infections that our experts and scientists predicted over 3 months ago has now arrived. It started in the Western Cape and is now underway in the Eastern Cape and Gauteng. “Gauteng is fast approaching 100,000 confirmed cases. The Eastern Cape has passed 50,000 cases, and although the rate of transmission has slowed in the Western Cape, it will soon have 80,000 cases.” According to current projections, Ramaphosa said that each of the country’s provinces will reach the peak of infections at different times between the end of July and late September. “We owe the relatively low number of deaths in our country to the experience and dedication of our health professionals and the urgent measures we have taken to build the capacity of our health system which faced a number of its own inherent challenges before Covid-19. “We must remember that the most important measure of success is the number of lives we save,” he said.
