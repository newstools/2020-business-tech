Huawei has unveiled the Y6p smartphone, which offers impressive features and performance at an affordable price. The Huawei Y6p boasts a triple-lens camera that comprises a 13MP main camera, a 5MP wide-angle camera, and a 2MP depth camera. This enables it to take extremely impressive photographs for a phone in its price range. It also has an 8MP front camera that uses advanced beautification algorithms to ensure users can take great selfies. One of the most impressive elements of the Huawei Y6p is that it has a huge 5,000mAh battery. This allows users to enjoy up to 32 hours of video playback, or 20 hours of Internet surfing, on a single charge. This large battery has another great use – the Y6p can be used as a power bank to charge other devices. This can be extremely useful if you are using several devices but one has run out of power. Other impressive features of the Y6p include its 3GB of RAM and 64GB of onboard storage. When paired with the smartphone’s Mediatek MT6762R chipset, this makes the Huawei Y6p more than capable of running everyday applications and mobile games. The 6.3-inch HD+IPS display on the Huawei Y6p is bright and delivers a clear image, and it stretches across the front of the smartphone, leaving almost no bezels around it. A fingerprint sensor is also mounted on the rear of the chassis for accessible security. The Huawei Y6p also boasts impressive sound capabilities that will ensure your calls, videos, and music sound clear. The smartphone uses Huawei SuperSound, which uses large sound chambers for audio components to ensure better resonance, increase speaker volume, and improve quality. This is improved further with Huawei Histen 6.0, which ensures a more immersive audio experience. The Huawei Y6p comes in three colours – Midnight Black, Phantom Purple, and Emerald Green. It can be purchased through the Huawei Store for R3,299, and it is also available at the following retailers: Takealot
