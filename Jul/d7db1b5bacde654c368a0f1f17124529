Nedbank has launched a new scan-to-park technology in conjunction with global digital access developer, SKIDATA. Scan-to-park allows anyone with a Masterpass-enabled QR code scanning banking app, or digital wallet, to scan their parking ticket and make instant payment – without ever having to handle cash or physically touch a parking pay station. Josephine Baliah, head of acceptance business solutions for Nedbank, said: “Scan-to-park is a great example of how we are keeping our promise to harness the power of digital innovation to make payments easier and more convenient for all South Africans.” Using a QR code app on your smartphone and scanning the QR code printed on a scan-to-park ticket, the payment transaction is instantly completed and confirmed, and you can then exit
the parking lot by inserting or scanning your ticket at the exit point. Scan-to-park leverages Masterpass, Mastercard’s scan-to-pay service, which enables consumers to transact with any bank card through a secure app on their mobile phones. Each Masterpass transaction is protected by multiple layers of security, ensuring the user’s personal and payment details are protected. Scan-to-park ticket vending machines are already in use at a number of leading shopping malls in Gauteng, including Melrose Arch, Sandton City, and Nelson Mandela Square, and are currently being rolled out to Eastgate and Liberty Midlands Mall. A total of 99 shopping centres across the country have been earmarked for installation of the technology in the coming months, Nedbank said.
