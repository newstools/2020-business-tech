South Africa’s annual consumer price inflation fell to its lowest reading since September 2004, dragged lower mainly by falling fuel prices, according to data from Statistics South Africa. The Consumer Price Index (CPI), which measures the prices of a range of consumer goods and services, increased by 2.1% in May 2020 compared with May 2019. The reading for September 2004, 15 years and eight months ago, was 1.3%, the stats body said. The monthly change in the CPI (from April 2020 to May 2020) was -0.6%. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-416515" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CPI-scaled-e1594803957237.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="795" /> Fuel a major drag on CPI The most significant price move in May was the fall in fuel prices, StatsSA said.
