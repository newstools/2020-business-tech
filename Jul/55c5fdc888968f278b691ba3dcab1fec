Three South African business schools have been ranked among the top 150 in the world, in the latest QS Global Executive MBA Rankings for 2020. According QS, the rankings are compiled by combining input from thought leaders in business and management alongside the perceptions of global employers who recruit from the world’s best EMBA programs. This is further enhanced by program-specific indicators. The results bring together over 150 schools and programs, each of which were surveyed between December 2019 and February 2020. A total of 161 programs were ranked, 20 of which are joint EMBA programs, it said. In order for a school to be eligible, two preconditions must be met: Schools must have at least one graduating class.
Schools must have either AACSB, AMBA, EQUIS or EPAS accreditation. The methodology looks at the QS Employer Survey and Academic Surveys, which account for 30% and 25 % of the ranking weight, respectively. Executive Profile, which includes average years’ work experience, managerial experience, and c-suite experience make up 15% of the ranking weight. Career Outcomes make up 20% of the ranking weight, which includes salary uplift within a year of graduation, as well as the percentage of students who were promoted within a year of graduation. The remaining 10% of the ranking weight is Diversity of class, which includes both the representation levels of women and number of nationalities among a program’s students.
