The South Africans Revenue Service (SARS) hasstarted sending out SMSes to taxpayers about a possible discrepancy in their information. Specialist firm Tax Consulting SA said that the message typically informs the taxpayer that they are being reviewed and that there are ‘discrepancies identified’. It provided the below example: This communication appears a result of SARS’ new three-phased automated filing process, explained Tax Consulting SA. “During phase one, which ran from 15 April – 31 May, third party providers submitted information that will be used to auto-assess taxpayers. “Third-party providers include employers, banks, insurers, retirement fund administrators, retirement funds and medical schemes. “During phase two, which runs from 1 June – 31 August, taxpayers and tax practitioners were asked to do ‘hygiene checks’ of their taxpayer information, meaning they have to ensure their information on their tax profile is up to date, to avoid mismatches with data provided by third parties.” Tax Consulting SA said that the information can relate to anything from bank details to addresses. As phase two progresses, SARS is informing taxpayers where they have picked up discrepancies between information they have on file and data submitted by third parties, which would prompt the communication in question, it said.
