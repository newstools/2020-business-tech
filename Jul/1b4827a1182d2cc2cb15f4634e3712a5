Multichoice-owned online streaming service Showmax is launching a new service, Showmax Pro, which bundles the existing entertainment service with music channels, news, and live sport streaming from SuperSport. The service will initially roll out in Nigeria and Kenya, with additional countries following shortly after. It is understood that the service will launch in South Africa as part of the rollout, but a specific date has not been set down as yet. Pricing and sport content may also vary when the service launches locally. “Showmax Pro features all Premier League, Serie A, La Liga, and PSL games as well as a wide range of live sport events including IAAF Athletics, professional boxing, and the world’s biggest marathons,” the group said. “The service will begin to roll out in Kenya and Nigeria from 7 July. Additional countries will go live in the following weeks. The entire process is expected to be completed within 6-8 weeks with coverage across sub-Saharan Africa.” The below table shows what the service will offer in Kenya and Nigeria. <img class="size-full wp-image-414093 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Showmax-Pro-1.png" alt="" width="774" height="475" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Showmax-Pro-1.png 774w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Showmax-Pro-1-300x184.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Showmax-Pro-1-768x471.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “Showmax is an African video on demand service with many years’ experience operating on this continent,” said Niclas Ekdahl, chief executive officer of the Connected Video division of MultiChoice. “We’re local-first, which means listening to our customers and delivering African stories told in familiar voices as well as the best that Hollywood has to offer. Our local-first strategy is an advantage because it allows us to tailor our content, apps, packages, and partnerships specifically to what’s most important in Africa.” In June 2019, Showmax began testing sport live-streaming, and the new Showmax Pro service is based on the results of this, Ekdahl said. “The live sport test we ran on Showmax in conjunction with SuperSport has been well received, so that’s forming an integral part of our new Showmax Pro service.” Another key development for African markets has been adapting the service for the data connectivity constraints on the continent and focusing on the most-used viewing devices, Ekdahl said. In November last year, Showmax launched a mobile-only service for smartphones and tablets featuring all of the Showmax content but at half the cost of the standard Showmax service and consuming less data. This service has also proven popular, so in addition to the standard version of Showmax Pro there will also be a mobile-only version at half the price, he said.
