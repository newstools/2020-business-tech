Eskom has announced that it will introduce stage 2 load shedding on Friday (10 July) as the country’s power system comes under increased change. The power utility said that the power cuts will be introduced from 12h00 to 22h00. The group said that two units at the Arnot station, as well as a unit each at Kendal, Tutuka and Majuba were taken off the grid, removing more than 2,600MW of capacity. It said that the delayed return to service of a generation unit at the Duvha power station, has also added significant pressure to the system.
