Eskom has urged the public to reduce electricity usage as its generation system remains constrained after losing two generation units – one each at Medupi and Tutuka – totalling 1,300MW. In a statement on Wednesday (8 July), Eskom said: “This morning one generation unit each at the Kendal and Tutuka power stations tripped, adding to the Tutuka unit that tripped yesterday evening. “Eskom teams are hard at work trying to return these units to service.” Eskom said that while the Medupi unit that tripped on Tuesday evening has been successfully returned to service, the power generation system remains constrained. “Any additional breakdowns will compromise Eskom’s ability to supply the country through the peak demand period of 17h00 – 21h00. This constrained supply situation may persist through the weekend. “We urge the public’s co-operation in managing demand in order to help us supply the country’s demand through the peak periods.”  The power utility has already begun to restrict power supply to those municipalities who have not made payment – ‘breaching its electricity supply agreement with Eskom’. Moreover, the group has also implemented a  ‘load reduction’ strategy to avoid network overloading in high-density areas prone to illegal connections, meter bypasses and vandalism of electricity infrastructure. The South African Weather Service meanwhile warned of ‘bitterly cold, wet and windy weather’ over parts of South Africa over the next few days.
