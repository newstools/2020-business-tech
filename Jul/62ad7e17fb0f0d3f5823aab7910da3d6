Power utility, Eskom says it will move stage 1 load shedding on Wednesday (15 July) following the restoration of some power generating units. The utility said that it was able to return a generation unit at the Medupi and Majuba power stations to service. In addition, a unit at the Koeberg station was synchronised into the grid on Monday. “This additional capacity has significantly reduced the strain on the generation system. The progress, however, is still not sufficient to enable us to suspend this current unfortunate period of load shedding,” it said in a statement. Eskom said that stage 1 load shedding will start at 09h00 on Wednesday morning, and will continue to 22h00.  “Eskom wishes to assure the public that implementing load-shedding is the last resort, in order to protect the national grid,” it said. The group noted that the colder weather has also led to a significant increase in the demand for electricity. “We, therefore, urge the public to continue assisting us in managing consumption in order to reduce the impact of supply constraints,” Eskom said.
