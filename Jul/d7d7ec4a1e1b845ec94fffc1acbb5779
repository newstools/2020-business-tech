Minister of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma has published a new directive which updates the country’s level 3 lockdown rules. While much of the focus has been placed on the reintroduction of restrictions – including a ban on the sale of alcohol and a new evening curfew – the directive also outlines a number of specific restrictions. Notably, the following activities are specifically prohibited under the new directive: Hotels, lodges, bed and breakfasts, timeshare facilities and resorts and guest houses, for leisure purposes; Short term home-sharing /letting /leasing /rental; Domestic passenger air travel for leisure purposes; Passenger ships for leisure purposes; Beaches; Public parks, except for exercising and subject to health protocols; Sporting events, except for those provided for by the minister; Exclusions relating to public transport except for those provided for by the minister; Exclusions relating to education services except for those provided for by the minister. Cigarette ban The directive also draws specific attention to the continued ban on the sale of e-cigarettes and cigarettes. The directive states that: The sale of tobacco, tobacco products, e-cigarettes and related products to members of the public and to persons including retailers who sell directly to the members of the public, is prohibited; The sale of tobacco, tobacco products, e-cigarettes and related products for export, is permitted; The sale of tobacco from farmers to local processors or local manufacturers, and from processors to manufacturers, is permitted. No visiting friends and family While not specifically prohibited in the directives, president Cyril Ramaphosa made it clear in his Sunday evening address (12 July) that South Africans are not permitted to visit friends and family for social calls. “There are some activities that present too much of a risk for infection – for this reason family visits and other social activities will unfortunately not be allowed for now,” the president said. “I know this places a great burden on families and individuals and can cause great emotional strain, especially those with elderly parents. But it is a hardship we must endure for that much longer to protect those we love and care for.” Read: This is the permit you need to travel under South Africa’s new curfew
