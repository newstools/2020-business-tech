These aircons feature powerful technology and innovative features to effectively heat up or cool down your living or work areas according to your preferences. Samsung air conditioners are equipped with Fast Cooling technology, allowing you to cool a room 43% faster than conventional aircons. The uniquely triangular design of the air outlet optimises airflow by providing an improved width and angle, while extra V-blades ensure that air is expelled farther and wider. Additionally, Samsung’s air conditioners feature its Wind-Free Cooling, which gently disperses air through 23,000 micro air holes. This means they are designed to cool and heat large areas, without blasting you with waves of wind. Bio Sleep (or Good Sleep) mode is another excellent innovation that automatically manages the temperature of your room while you are sleeping. The quality of air emitted by your air conditioner is another important attribute to consider, as it can have a big impact on your lung health and breathing. Samsung air conditioners use high-quality filters that prevent dirty air from blowing into your room. These filters capture dust, allergens, and more – which ensures the air you are breathing is fresh and uncontaminated. Their High Density filter is also washable, so you are able to maintain it yourself to continue breathing fresh, clean air. While air conditioners are renowned for being thirsty for electricity, using Samsung’s air conditioners will prevent bill shock. This is because they use energy-saving techniques that save you money and have less of an impact on the environment. In addition, Samsung’s digital inverter technology maintains your desired temperature without the need to turn the air conditioner on and off, which results in less power fluctuation in the home. All these fantastic features make Samsung’s air conditioners the perfect solution for warming and cooling the spaces you need to, any time of the year.
