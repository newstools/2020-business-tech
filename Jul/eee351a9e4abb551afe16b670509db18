We’ve all experienced those frustrating moments when your Wi-Fi does not reach every room in the house or every corner at the office because the Wi-Fi signal is too weak. These areas are often referred to as blind spots. Luckily, there are a few basic solutions to this common problem, such as adding an additional router in the blind spot to boost the signal. However, for this to work, a plug point is needed. So what happens is there if there aren’t any connection points to plug the network cable into? Well, this is where the 5G CPE comes in handy. Now, we all know what 5G is, and that it’s revolutionising connectivity, but what does CPE mean? Generally speaking, CPE, which stands for ‘customer premise equipment’, is a combination of mobile routers and mobile Wi-Fi, which are the ideal network solution for families, businesses, exhibitions and telemedicine. You can use the CPE to transfer your wireless networks (5G/4G) to your Wi-Fi router, just like the Huawei Mobile router, which allows you to relay mobile phone signals and turn them into a Wi-Fi signal. Essentially, this allows you to solve the problem of poor broadband coverage in order to meet your internet access needs, anytime and anywhere. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-416731" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-1.png" alt="Huawei" width="640" height="453" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-1.png 830w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-1-300x213.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-1-768x544.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="wp-image-416733 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-2.png" alt="Huawei" width="640" height="453" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-2.png 830w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-2-300x213.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-2-768x544.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> 5G CPE essentially enables you to transform your 4G/5G signals into a Wi-Fi hotspot. This means that you’ll be able to connect your smartphone, PC and other devices wherever you are in the house or office – even if you’re in a blind spot. Since the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic, millions of people across the globe have been isolated at home and working remotely. This has caused a huge demand for increased network speeds, which will help our new remote workforce to avoid network cuts during important meetings or when a deadline is looming. Furthermore, we know that since we’ve been stuck at home a lot of the time, we’ve also had to look for new ways to entertain ourselves. This includes activities like online mobile gaming or online streaming, which also requires sufficient network speeds. A solution to all of these potential issues would be to use a 5G CPE, which will allow you to upload or download videos instantly, livestream in 8K/4K high definition graphics and unlock the full potential of AR/VR. 5G is also becoming increasingly popular as a business connectivity solution, thanks to its speed, and the fact that it can be applied in different scenarios in both B2B and B2C businesses. The use of this technology is evident in items like AR screens in retail stores and smart office capabilities with real-time meetings. In the medical sector, this technology can also assist doctors with diagnosing patients remotely, by using the 5G network to transfer massive amounts of health data and even monitor a patient’s condition in real-time. Well, you can. But you probably already know that customers wanting to install a cable network wait an average of 3 to 4 weeks to get it installed and fully operational. From trucking, digging, cabling and installing (not to mention the high service costs), the process can be quite a lengthy one. On top of all that admin, the fact that we’re currently in a global pandemic also makes it a bit risky to let service staff come into your home to install the cable connection. 5G CPE, however, eliminates the need for the long-term wireline preparation, as well as those unnecessary call-out costs. All you need to do is to plug and play. Since we’re on the topic of 5G, we can’t help but mention Huawei, who already leads in 5G and Wi-Fi 6 globally. Recently the tech giant unveiled the Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2, a next-gen smart router from the Huawei 5G CPE Pro series. The Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 supports a wide range of 5G frequency bands, more than any other equivalent 5G product on the market. The Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2 packs Huawei’s innovative 5G Super Uplink technology, as well as the latest Wi-Fi 6 standard, into a compact form and is 30% smaller than its predecessor. The device’s game-changing capabilities will undoubtedly have enormous implications for various fields, including home mobile broadband, HD live broadcasting, telemedicine, and video conferencing. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-416735" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-3.png" alt="Huawei" width="640" height="319" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-3.png 830w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-3-300x150.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Huawei-3-768x383.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> South Africa’s first 5G network has already arrived from Rain. The Rain “5G for home” package provides unlimited data 24/7, a free-to-use premium 5G router and your choice of network speed from only R699 a month. Other carriers such as MTN and Vodacom will also soon be launching packages featuring the Huawei 5G CPE Pro 2. This article was published in partnership with Huawei.
