Findings from researchers at the University of Johannesburg (UJ) and the Human Sciences Research Council (HSRC) show that the majority South Africans believe schools should close for the remainder of the year. The survey sampled 2,500 people on their thoughts around the possible closure of schools in the country, amid a pandemic that has already claimed the lives of more than 5,000 people, including teachers and pupils. The survey comes on the backdrop of education unions pushing for schools to close. The Department of Education re-opened schools to some students in early June, however, many have been forced to close again due to increasing number of infections reported. Unions have made presentations to the Department of Basic Education and minister Angie Motshekga, calling for the immediate closure of schools – to be reopened again in August – along with other proposals to ensure the safety of teachers and learners. These include: Education departments should provide teachers with the necessary tools to work from home and prepare work for the reopening of schools and return of learners; Grade 12s should be prioritised and different modes to assist them while they are at home should be investigated. Grade 12s should return on Monday, 17 August 2020; The DBE and stakeholders should discuss the curriculum post this calendar year, focusing on reading for the remaining months of 2020; The Department of Higher Education and Training should be engaged to consider late registration for first years in 2021; All stakeholders should focus on advocacy campaigns, educating the nation about this invisible enemy but also urging them to follow all precautionary measures, including staying at home. Views on the closure of schools and the further delay in the curriculum have been divisive, with some commentators and academics arguing that the move would be detrimental to children, and the economy. However, the call for closures has also received wide support, particularly from educators and political parties. According to education minister Angie Motshekga, the decision is now sitting with cabinet and the National Coronavirus Command Council – with unions demanding an answer by the end of the week. Support for closing schools The survey results shows that support among the adults polled is weighted in favour of closing schools, and not re-opening them for the remainder of the year. According to the survey, 60.4% of adults most agreed that schools should not re-open fully this year. The second-most popular view was that schools should only re-open for those in grade 7 or 12 (21.1%). <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-418813" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Survey-results.png" alt="" width="727" height="436" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Survey-results.png 727w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Survey-results-300x180.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This was a consistent view across income levels and political alignments, the researchers noted. While DA supporters are more likely to agree with re-opening of schools for all grades, followed by the ANC and then the EFF. “This may reflect income differences among the parties’ potential voters. Nevertheless a majority from all three parties was opposed to schools re-opening,” they said. Professor Kate Alexander, South African Research chair in Social Change at UJ pointed out that the survey’s findings will come as a blow to the government, as it continues to ponder what to do about schools. “It may want to re-consider its present policy,” Alexander said. According to the university, the results are representative at a national level, having been weighted by race, age and educational level.
