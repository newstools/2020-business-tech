US tech giant Amazon has unveiled a trolley that uses sensors to detect the items you’re adding when you go shopping. Called Amazon Dash Cart, the e-commerce firm said: “It’s a new smart shopping cart that makes a quick grocery trip even quicker by allowing you to skip the checkout line.” The cart uses a combination of computer vision algorithms and sensor fusion to identify items you put in the cart. “When you exit through the store’s Amazon Dash Cart lane, sensors automatically identify the cart, and your payment is processed using the credit card on your Amazon account.” According to Amazon, the cart has some convenient features for grocery shopping, including a screen at the top where you can access your Alexa Shopping List to check items oﬀ and view your subtotal. “In addition, every cart is equipped with a coupon scanner where you can quickly apply store coupons as you shop.” The cart will initially be available at the Amazon grocery store in Woodland Hills, California in 2020. “When the cart is available, there will be a QR code in the Amazon app that will enable you to easily sign in and begin using the cart. After that, you’ll just place your bags in the cart and start shopping, Amazon said. When you’re done shopping, you’ll simply exit through the store’s Amazon Dash Cart lane, and your receipt will be emailed to you. The group said that the trolley is specifically designed for small- to medium-sized grocery trips and fits two grocery bags. “You can shop our entire grocery selection using the cart,” it said.
