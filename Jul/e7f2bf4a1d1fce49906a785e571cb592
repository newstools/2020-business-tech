South Africa’s largest private medical aid, Discovery Medical Scheme, has published new data on the emergent hotspots for Covid-19 infections. The data is based on real-time claims and Discovery has begun using this data to notify customers if they live in an area with a high number of new cases. The data does not necessarily reflect the suburbs which currently have the highest number of reported cases. “Given the large, national footprint of our membership base and in order to support you with more information to stay safe during Covid-19, we are communicating on the emergent hotspots for Covid-19 infections using real-time claims data,” it said. “We analyse our data across the country, at a district level, to ensure that we can provide you with regular updates on how the pandemic is progressing in your area.” Discovery said that a client’s membership claims information, as well as their residential address on its system, are used to inform when they will receive these hotspot notifications. The financial services company defines a ‘hotspot’ as having the following: At least two new infections per day on average for prior seven days;
At least 50 cumulative cases;
Either 5% Compound Growth Rate (CGR) over the prior seven days (doubling time of two weeks or less)/Or at least 30 new cases per 100,000 Discovery lives over the prior 7 days (high attack rate). The group highlighted the following areas of concern below, calculated as of 22 July.
