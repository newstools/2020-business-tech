The City of Johannesburg says it is moving ahead with a massive plan to ‘de-densify’ parts of the city in a bid to mitigate the growth of informal settlements and help lower-income people adhere to social distancing protocols. In a statement on Friday (17 July), executive mayor Geoff Makhubo said the city it will initially focus on the Rabie Ridge in Midrand. Makhubo says the plan is to build temporary housing in Rabie Ridge, which will accommodate 6,000 residents from informal settlements across the city in line with social distancing and other Covid-19 protocols. Town planners believe the densification of urban areas degrades the quality of existing space and places greater burdens on an already creaking infrastructure, he said. He added that highly-dense areas make it impossible for people to observe public health regulations promulgated to combat the spread of the infectious Covid-19 pandemic. “We need to start with temporary housing to de-densify informal settlements by moving qualifying beneficiaries. This is a step in the right direction,” he said.
