Despite the huge surge that made South Africa rank with the fifth highest number of positive coronavirus cases in the world, there are reasons to be hopeful says Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. Speaking in a virtual Covid-19 conference, Mkhize said that the country has successfully mobilised support from medical experts who advise on protocols to put in place for containment, to control cluster outbreaks and to guide day to day management. He added that government’s decision to implement lockdown based on an alert level system as well as the slow re-opening of the economy is starting to bear fruit. “The Western Cape has passed the peak and maintained a plateau for the past two months, while early indications of a promising decline are observed in Eastern Cape and Gauteng,” he said. “For these reasons we have to intensify the non-pharmaceutical interventions and emphasise behavioural change to force the reduction of new infections in all provinces.” He added that the country’s recovery rate is encouraging. “It has increased to 64% indicating that more people have overcome the infection than those who are infected and test positive. “Lessons on case management and discovery of effective medications such as dexamethasone, early use of oxygen – including a preference for non-invasive oxygen support – and other treatment regiments has resulted in a low mortality consistently below 2%. “Our current fatalities stand at 7,812 and we extend our condolences to all South Africans that have lost loved ones due to Covid-19”.  Despite this positivity, Mkhize said that there are still a number of areas of concern and interventions that the government was still working on.
