Telkom has unveiled what it claims is a complete online education solution for learners through the Lightbulb Education platform. It said in a statement on Monday (13 July), that currently learners, teachers, and parents are using a combination of platforms and material to continue learning at home and to catch-up on the curriculum. Lightbulb Education, it said, combines these learning experiences onto one platform. The platform focuses on mathematics and the sciences for Grade 10 to Grade 12 learners with the addition of Grades  7 – 9 on 1 August 2020. Lightbulb Education focuses on the goals of the learner and creates a path to achieve this goal through a personalised learning journey. The telco noted that most classrooms in South Africa have over 50 learners per class with one teacher having to give enough attention to each child. This is impossible in most cases, resulting in some children being left behind. 2020 has added additional strain to this already tenuous situation with teachers and parents now having to help learners to catch-up on teaching time lost during the lockdown period. “The service is offered for free to Telkom customers, and we have also zero-rated data for all Telkom customers which means that all customers can access it for free both on mobile and fixed line products,” said Wanda Mkhize, executive for content at Telkom. Learners are able to cover specific topics by grade, test themselves, and participate in group tutoring sessions. The platform empowers parents to keep track of their children’s progress through personalised reports and notifications, Mkhize said. Teachers can also use the platform to  prepare lessons, create tests and assessments, and monitor class progress on learning material. Telkom said it has also invested in Lightbulb Education through its FutureMakers investment fund that backs innovative small technology businesses.
