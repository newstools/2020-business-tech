Power utility Eskom says that it will again implement stage 2 load shedding on Sunday, following a full day of rolling blackouts on Saturday. Sunday load shedding will start at 08h00 and continue until 22h00. Further, Eskom noted that while it is “working around the clock” to return generating units to service, the system strain is likely to persist all week. Load shedding is needed to continue to restore emergency reserves to better prepare for next week. Due to the much colder weather, electricity demand has increased significantly, it said.
