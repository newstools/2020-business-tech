Online advertising is the best way to promote your business, brand, product, or service. This fact was proven by Nielsen’s Media ROI Benchmarks report for South Africa, which showed that digital advertising spend gives companies the best return on investment. Digital advertising easily outperforms TV, print, radio, and out-of-home advertising. Today, we take a look at one of the most powerful forms of online advertising: Native Adverts. Native Adverts are advertisements which don’t feel or look like traditional adverts, and they are incredibly effective. 2020 advertising trends reports from HubSpot show that Native Adverts offer multiple benefits over traditional online adverts, including: People view Native Adverts over 50% more than banners ads.
31% of people are more likely to buy from a brand after viewing their Native Adverts. The most effective form of Native Adverts is content marketing, also known as sponsored articles, advertorials, or partner content. Sponsored articles allow a business to advertise themselves, and their products or services, in a way that fits in with the look and feel of the online platform they are advertising on. It also adds one of the most crucial elements a company needs in advertising to succeed: trust. South Africans trust articles more than any other form of online advertising. According to the 2020 South African Business Marketing Report, articles are by far the most trusted form of online advertising. <img class="size-full wp-image-413731 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles.jpg" alt="Articles" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> It is for this reason that BusinessTech developed its sponsored article marketing product – which delivers an advertising message in this highly-trusted format.
