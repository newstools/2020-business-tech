The Department of Basic Education (DBE) has announced the postponed return of a number of school grades citing the rising number of coronavirus cases in the country. The department said that the decision was taken after the Council of Ministers (CEM) received a number of briefings from education stakeholders. “After careful consideration of all the reports CEM took a decision that only Grade 6, Grade 11 and Grade R will return to school on Monday (6 July). “The decision affects all provinces. The other grades will be phased (in) during the month of July in a differentiated approach within the stipulated time frames as per the gazette of 29 June as published by the minister.” Minister of Basic Education Angie Motshekga said that her department will adjust the reopening of phases based on a risk-adjusted strategy. “We are guided in this by an observation of the rising numbers of community transmissions throughout the country. “We recognise that schools are based in communities and learners live in the same affected communities and therefore a careful balancing act must be maintained.  The below table shows the return dates of the various grades based on the gazette published on 29 June. Further directives are expected to provide clarity on the grades which will no longer return on 6 July.  Read: These are the new ‘harder’ lockdown restrictions Gauteng is looking at
