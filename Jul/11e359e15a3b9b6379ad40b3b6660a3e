Rain says it has rolled out its 5G service in Cape Town, following an initial launch in Gauteng last year. The company said its 5G offering will be available in Cape Town from 18 July 2020. “Rain 5G offers super-fast unlimited internet from as little as R699 per month,” it said. The company will offer both its Standard and Premium Unlimited 5G packages in Cape Town, priced at R699 and R999 per month, respectively. Rain’s standard package caps speeds at 30Mbps and allows a single HD video stream, while its Premium package offers multiple HD+ quality streams and has no speed limitations. “Premium users can expect average speeds exceeding 200Mbps,” Rain said. The company noted that it has built additional 5G sites in Gauteng in recent months, as part of an expanded  coverage. “Furthermore, Rain hopes to blanket more metro areas though out South Africa in the next 18 months.” Rain chief marketing officer Khaya Dlanga said: “By rolling out the most affordable 5G unlimited products in the market, Rain is playing its part in building the 5G ecosystem in the country.” “5G can significantly increase ultra-broadband penetration in the country which supports economic growth and will enable South Africans to remain productive by working from home during the COVID-19 pandemic.” The following 5G products will be offered by Rain in Cape Town: Unlimited Home 5G Standard – R699pm (Speed limited to 30Mpbs, one HD stream)
