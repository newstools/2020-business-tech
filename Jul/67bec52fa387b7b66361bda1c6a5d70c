The outlook on domestic demand for new vehicle continues to remain under severe pressure, notes the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers Association (Naamsa), responding to June’s vehicle sales numbers for South Africa. “Middle class disposable income was already under huge strain prior to the national lockdown resulting from Covid-19, which has significantly exacerbated the already weak macro-economic climate in the country.” Vehicle sales were up month-on-month after the government lifted lockdown enabling the industry to get back to work. June 2020 sales however, declined 30% year-on-year, with passenger cars down 33.4% over the same month a year ago. Overall, Naamsa reported 31,867 unit sales for June, with Toyota accounting for 8,193 units, thanks to a strong month from its Hilux brand, accounting for in excess of 3,000 units. Volkswagen sold 4,383 and Hyundai 2,422. Japanese automaker Suzuki sold 1,433 units in June, and can expect to increase that number as the country emerges from the pandemic, with buying patters changing  – consumers are looking for more affordable vehicles. Suzuki notes that it is the only brand to be nominated every year since inception for the Brand of the Year Award, as awarded at the Cars.co.za Consumer Awards, powered by WesBank. Suzuki has won that award twice and is the most awarded brand in the Budget Car of the Year category in the same competition. The group also reports multiple finalists in the AutoTrader Car of the Year competition and its Swift and Jimny models were category winners in the 2019 Car of the Year competition. Its latest price list, effective 1 July 2020, shows that it has as many as five models priced below R200,000, and an SUV for less than R300,000: S-Presso <img class="aligncenter size-full
