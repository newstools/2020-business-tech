Chief magistrates across the country have begun to publish updated lockdown admission of guilt penalties. The schedules are based on provincial and magistrate districts and are in line with the new level 3 lockdown regulations, introduced in June and July. The South African Police Service can give a person who has been arrested on suspicion of a less serious crime an option to pay an admission of guilt fine. Such a fine allows a person to admit guilt for a less serious offence without having to appear in court, thereby preventing an unnecessary overload of the court system. It is also meant to resolve less serious matters quickly where an accused person accepts responsibility for having committed a minor offence. However, an admission of guilt comes with a criminal record. Thousands of people have already paid an admission of guilt fine since the National State of Disaster was first declared, while just under 200,000 were scheduled to appear in court. While the fines differ between regions, the below table provides an idea of what you can expect to pay based on the latest directive for KwaZulu-Natal. It should be noted that some offences do not have an association of guilt fine attached, possibly a sign of their perceived severity under the revised level 3 lockdown rules. These offences include: The sale of tobacco products;
The prohibited transportation of liquor;
The sale and dispensing of liquor;
Hindering, interfering or obstructing an enforcement officer during the course of their duties. You can find the most up to date schedules for each province under the ‘Covid-19 guilty fines’ tab here.
