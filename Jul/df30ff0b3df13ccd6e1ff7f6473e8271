Power utility Eskom says that stage 2 load shedding will also be implemented on Saturday (11 July), starting from 09h00 and continuing to 22h00. The group said that, while it expects some generating units to return overnight, load shedding will need to continue to restore emergency reserves to better prepare for next week. Due to the much colder weather, electricity demand has increased significantly, it said. “Three of six generation units contributing to earlier breakdowns have been successfully returned to service at the Tutuka, Arnot and Matimba power stations,” it said. “This has had the net effect of reducing plant breakdowns 2,350MW of capacity.” The delayed return to service of a generation unit at the Devha power station has also contributed to the strained system. Load shedding is currently underway, with Eskom expecting to only suspend it at 22h00.
