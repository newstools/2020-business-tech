South Africans trust articles more than any other form of online advertising. This was a finding in the 2020 South African Business Marketing Report, which detailed the types of advertising people respond to the best. It is for this reason that BusinessTech developed the Sponsored Article marketing product – which delivers an advertising message in a trusted format. “If you want to build trust among your audience, then you must share your message with them in a way that inspires trust,” said BusinessTech MD Kevin Lancaster. “A Sponsored Article lets you speak to your audience in a one-on-one conversation. By including statements from executives or professionals within your company in the article, you also give your organisation a human face – which is a powerful way to connect with customers.” <img class="size-full wp-image-413731 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles.jpg" alt="Articles" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Sponsored Articles are not only a powerful way to reach your audience, they are easy to create and publish. “Many companies think content is hard to create. It’s not,” said Lancaster. “We can repurpose existing press releases and company blog posts, or write a new article based on a short brief. Content is what we specialise in as an online publisher.” The impressive results Sponsored Article campaigns deliver for BusinessTech clients is evidence of their effectiveness.
