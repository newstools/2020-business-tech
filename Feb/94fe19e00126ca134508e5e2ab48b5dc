J.D. Power, a provider of consumer insights, advisory services and data and analytics, has published its 2020 US Vehicle Dependability Study – showing that overall vehicle dependability improved 1.5% from 2019. The study measures the number of problems per 100 vehicles (PP100) experienced during the past 12 months by original owners of their three-year-old vehicles. The 2020 study measures problems in model-year 2017 vehicles. A lower score reflects higher quality, and the study covers 177 specific problems grouped into eight major vehicle categories. “Despite the increased adoption of complex vehicle technology, dependability continues to improve,” said Dave Sargent, vice president of global automotive at J.D. Power. “There’s no question that three-year-old vehicles today are better built and more dependable than same-age vehicles were in previous years. However, the rapid introduction of technology is putting increased pressure on dependability, so it would not be surprising to see problem levels plateau, or even increase, over the next few years.” The 2020 study found that vehicle dependability improved—but at a slower rate. And despite the slowing rate of improvement, 2020 marked automakers’ best performance in the history of the study. Crossovers and SUVs still have slightly more problems than cars, but the gap is narrowing, the study found. On average, owners of crossovers/SUVs experience 134 PP100, compared with 127 PP100 by car owners. This 7 PP100 gap has narrowed considerably from 2019. With crossovers/SUVs now accounting for more than 50% of new vehicle sales annually, it is critical that automakers achieve the same level of quality and dependability as for cars, J.D. Power said. Most Dependable Model The Lexus ES is the highest-ranked model in the 2020 study. Its score of 52 PP100 is the best ever recorded in the 31-year history of the study. The Nissan LEAF is the first all-electric model to receive a segment-level award, for compact car, J.D. Power noted. Highest-Ranked Brands Genesis ranks highest in overall vehicle dependability among all brands, with a score of 89 PP100. This is the first year Genesis has been included in the study. Lexus ranks second with a score of 100 PP100 (an improvement of 6 PP100 year over year). Buick (103 PP100) ranks third, Porsche (104 PP100) ranks fourth and Toyota (113 PP100) ranks fifth. Toyota Motor Corporation receives six segment awards for the Lexus ES, Lexus GX, Toyota 4Runner, Toyota Avalon, Toyota Sienna and Toyota Tundra. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-373912" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-JD-Power-Dependability-Study.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="960" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-JD-Power-Dependability-Study.jpg 720w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/2020-JD-Power-Dependability-Study-225x300.jpg 225w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: The best bakkie in South Africa – based on Average Joe’s needs
