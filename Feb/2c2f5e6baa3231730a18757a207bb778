Gauteng is set to introduce a new ticket system which will be usable across all major transport systems across the province. Presenting his State of the Province Address (Sopa) on Tuesday (15 February), premier David Makhura said that the system will be developed by the newly established Gauteng Transport Authority. “The first priority of this authority is to establish a single ticket so that those who re using buses, taxis, trains (including the Gautrain), and any other transport can move from one part of the province to the other using a single ticket. “In the end, we want integrated, reliable, affordable and efficient public transport,” he said. The idea of a single-ticket system was first mooted in 2017, while a similar systemwas trialled in Pretoria by the South African National Taxi Council (Santaco) for minibus taxi commuters in 2016. That project enabled commuters on the Johannesburg, Pretoria and Mabopane (JPM) route to use a single card to pay for all their transactions. Gautrain Makhura said that his government would also engage with the Competition Commission following the release of its recent public transport report. He indicated that this includes a proposal to integrate the Metrorail and the Gautrain services. In its report, the Competition Commission said that the government was unfairly subsidising Gautrain users in favour of the middle class. “The Gautrain is heavily subsidised and operates very differently from Metro Rail from a services and integration point of view,” said Competition Commission commissioner Tembinkosi Bonakele. The commission recommended that the Gauteng provincial government take over the control and management of Metro Rail, and integrate it with the Gautrain to pave the way for ‘a single system that doesn’t separate people according to class’.
