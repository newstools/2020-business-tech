The Gauteng City-Region Observatory has published a new map highlighting the province’s fast-growing residential areas – including housing, gated estates and informal dwellings. The map shows the way in which gated communities and boomed-off areas (marked in blue) occur in a wide band across the city-region, stretching from the east of Pretoria, through Centurion and into the northwestern parts of Johannesburg. “These relatively low-density developments, largely for more affluent residents, have increased significantly in recent decades,” the GCRO said. “Meanwhile, informal residential buildings occupied by poorer residents (marked in dark grey) are mostly located in and around townships that were planned under apartheid.” The GCRO said that the growth of informal accommodation is largely accounted for by the construction of backyard dwellings adjacent to formal township houses, making townships some of the densest settlements in the city region. Informal dwellings also occur on previously vacant land as informal settlements, it said. “This juxtaposition of blue and dark grey areas on the map shows dramatically how the privately-led production of housing on opposite ends of the affordability spectrum remains segregated on the regional scale. “On the local scale, gated communities and informal accommodation tend to be socially separated, but the two forms do spatially and functionally co-exist in some places, for example when informal housing develops close to employment opportunities.” <img class=" wp-image-378111 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing.png" alt="" width="1177" height="1589" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing.png 1667w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing-222x300.png 222w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing-759x1024.png 759w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing-768x1037.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing-1138x1536.png 1138w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing-1517x2048.png 1517w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Housing-1200x1620.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class=" wp-image-378115 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2.png" alt="" width="955" height="1413" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2.png 1667w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2-203x300.png 203w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2-692x1024.png 692w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2-768x1136.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2-1038x1536.png 1038w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2-1384x2048.png 1384w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/GCRO-2-1200x1775.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Public housing Alongside these two privately-led growth patterns, the map also represents the spatial distribution of public sector housing development plans (marked in green). Public sector housing plans, as envisaged in 2014, are generally much closer to informal residential buildings, and typically far from gated communities. There are good reasons for this, the GCRO said. “Some programmes are specifically aimed at informal settlement upgrading, while others seek to meet housing demand by providing formal housing close to informal settlements that need to be moved. “Another reason is that centrally located land is not at the required scale for large housing developments, and is usually too expensive. “Notwithstanding these valid reasons, the outcome is that housing provision at opposite ends of the housing spectrum remains spatially separated. This spatial separation is compounded by socio-economic inequality between settlement types.” Read: New district model to be rolled out across South Africa by 2021
