President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced plans to improve policing in South Africa – with a focus on improved police visibility, and training of police officers. In delivering his State of the Nation Address, the president said that the country’s goals of drawing investment and boosting growth require a safe, stable and crime-free environment. “More importantly, it is fundamental to the aspirations of all our people to live in security, peace and comfort,” he said. To achieve this, he said that police visibility, effective training and better resourcing of police stations are government’s priorities. “I have prioritised our response to the growing problem of criminal groups that extort money from construction and other businesses. “Specialised units – bringing together SAPS and the National Prosecuting Authority – are mandated to combat these crimes of economic disruption,” he said To support the growth of the tourism industry, the SAPS will increase visibility at identified tourist attraction sites. Government is also training Tourism Safety Monitors and will establish a reserve police capacity to focus on the policing of tourist attraction areas, he said. The president noted that, following the graduation of 5,000 police trainees last year, 7,000 new police trainees have been enlisted this year to strengthen local policing. To improve the quality of general and specialised SAPS investigations, government is establishing a Crime Detection University in Hammanskraal, north of Pretoria, he said.
