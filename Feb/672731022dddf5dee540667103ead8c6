FNB has announced that its eBucks Rewards programme has terminated its partnership with Dis-Chem. FNB said in a statement on Thursday (6 February), that it conducted a ‘thorough review’, with a decision made to end it’s partnership with the pharmacy group as of 31 March 2020. “If you have a qualifying FNB or RMB Private Bank cheque or credit card, all purchases made at Dis-Chem until 23:59 pm, on 31 March 2020, will still qualify for 1% back in eBucks. eBucks that have been earned will be allocated within the first two weeks of April 2020 for purchases made in March 2020,” it said. “eBucks members can look forward to an exciting new partnership that will be launched in April 2020,” it said.   Under the most recent terms, eBucks customers were able to earn 1% back at Dis-Chem when presenting their eBucks card at the till, or by entering their eBucks Card number when paying for online purchases.
