Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will again be implemented today. Rolling blackouts will start at 09h00 on Thursday and will extend to 06h00 on Saturday morning, with a high chance of it continuing for the rest of the weekend, the power utlity said. The reason for the implementation is the loss of three generating units overnight, which have significantly reduced capacity. Weekend load shedding will be needed to replenish reserves for next week, as emergency reserves have been used to supplement supply. Eskom warned that load shedding at short notice will likely be a feature in South Africans’ daily lives for the next 18 months.
