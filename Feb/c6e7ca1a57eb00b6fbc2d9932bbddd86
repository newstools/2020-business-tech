The Department of Home Affairs is working on a number of projects which will make it easier for citizens to get important documents such as ID cards and passports. Speaking in a parliamentary meeting on Tuesday (18 February), Thulani Mavuso, acting deputy director general (DDG) at Home Affairs said that his department would be further rolling out mobile truck offices which would offer Home Affairs services at schools and in rural areas. Following recent tests in the Northern Cape, Mavuso said that each truck was able to help around 290 learners in a single day. Mavuso said that his department was also currently in discussions to open some offices on Saturdays. However, he noted that this would likely not be a permanent arrangement and that the offices would only open on specific, pre-determined weekends. Mavuso explained that this was due to a shortage of staff and the costs involved around overtime payments. Discussions with the Education department Home Affairs minister Aaron Motsoaledi said that he had met with the minister and deputy minister of Basic Education to run a programme at schools so that students did not need to go to Home Affairs offices for identification documents. “We must run a programme whereby school kids are no longer allowed to go to Home Affairs offices during school hours for IDs,” Motsoaledi said. “At the moment we are still drawing (up) the programme. The limitation is that we only have 100 (Home Affairs) trucks which serve far away rural communities with no access. ” Motsoaledi added that an announcement on the programme would be made at a later date once the Department of Home Affairs and the Department of Education had considered all the resources that would be needed.
