The Department of Transport has published new toll tariffs for 2020, outlining the costs of travelling on South Africa’s national routes. While the new fees are controversial for the continued inclusion of e-tolls, the gazette also highlights how expensive it has become to travel to popular holiday destinations in South Africa. With petrol prices also expected to rise in 2020, long-distance travellers may now consider other modes of transport such as air travel or bus. This article is for comparison purposes only and does not include petrol and maintenance prices. All prices taken at 09h30 on 11 February 2020. <img class="wp-image-215809 size-full aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Johannesburg-Durban.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Johannesburg-Durban.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Johannesburg-Durban-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-215797 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cape-Town-Durban.jpg" alt="" width="660" height="434" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cape-Town-Durban.jpg 660w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Cape-Town-Durban-300x197.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Johannesburg/Pretoria to Port Elizabeth <img class="size-full wp-image-215803 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Johannesburg-Port-Elizabeth.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Johannesburg-Port-Elizabeth.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Johannesburg-Port-Elizabeth-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Plane <img class="aligncenter wp-image-110159" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Flysafair-plane-e1466670964680.jpg" alt="Flysafair plane" width="600" height="403" /> Bus <img class="aligncenter wp-image-372924" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="424" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus.jpg 2000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus-300x199.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus-1024x678.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus-768x509.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus-1536x1018.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Greyhound-bus-1200x795.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Using a bus remains one of the cheapest ways to travel in South Africa, with a number of companies offering one-way and return services to both larger and small towns.
