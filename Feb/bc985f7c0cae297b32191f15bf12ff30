Eskom will stop rotational load shedding at 17h00 on Saturday (22 February) due to improved generation system performance, offering customers some much-needed relief from power cuts in the evening. The power utility said that it will resume implementing rotational load shedding from 08h00 on Sunday (23 February). Eskom had previously warned that load shedding would continue throughout the entire weekend. “Two generation units have successfully returned to service earlier than expected this morning and the pumped-storage schemes have recovered adequately, setting us on a good course to full recovery by Monday morning. “Unplanned breakdowns have reduced, giving us some reprieve from load shedding during the night while affording us some headroom to replenish the emergency reserves to better meet the week’s demands.” Eskom warned that despite the relief from load shedding this evening, its system still remained constrained and unpredictable.
