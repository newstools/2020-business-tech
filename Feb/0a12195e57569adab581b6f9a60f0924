Power company Scatec Solar has connected and started early commercial operation on another 86 MW of power at its solar power complex in Upington. The 86 MW facility, known as Dyason’s Klip 1, is expected to produce 217 GWh and deliver clean energy to around 40,000 households annually, the company said. “This is another great achievement by our team in South Africa, bringing this important project online earlier than planned and supporting South African power supply in this time of much-needed electricity,” said Raymond Carlsen, chief executive officer of Scatec Solar. “We continue to develop renewable energy projects to support the country’s energy demand and we are ready to deliver new capacity, both within the utility-scale segment as well as towards private customers in the commercial and industrial spheres.” <img class="size-full wp-image-377245 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2.jpg" alt="" width="2048" height="1410" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-300x207.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-768x529.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-1536x1058.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-1200x826.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> When completed, the Upington solar power complex will provide clean energy for around 120,000 households and lead to the abatement of more than 600,000 tonnes of CO² emissions annually. The last of the three solar plants under construction is expected to reach commercial operation within the next few months, Carlsen said. The three projects are situated next to one another on adjacent plots,  approximately 25 kilometres outside of Upington in the Northern Cape. <img class="size-full wp-image-377257 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2.png" alt="" width="1276" height="635" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2.png 1276w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-300x149.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-1024x510.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-768x382.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Upington-2-1200x597.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The projects were awarded in April 2015 in the fourth bidding round under the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producer Programme (REIPPP) in South Africa. Scatec Solar owns 42%, Norfund holds 18%, the surrounding Community of Upington 5% and H1 Holdings, a South African Black investor holds the remaining 35% of the equity.
