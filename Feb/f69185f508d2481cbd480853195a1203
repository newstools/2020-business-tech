Car maker Peugeot has announced plans to enter the one-ton pick-up segment with the introduction of its new Landtrek bakkie. The Landtrek will be sold with two engine variants include a 1.9-litre diesel offering and a 2.4-litre petrol option. Diesel : 1.9L displacement and 150 hp thanks to a variable geometry 16-valve turbocharger. Its torque of 350 Nm and 6-speed Getrag manual gearbox. This engine has a combined fuel consumption of 7.8L/100kms;
Petrol : turbocharged with 2.4L displacement and a comfortable power output of 210 hp and 320 Nm of torque combined with a 6-speed Getrag manual gearbox or a 6-speed Punch automatic gearbox with sequential, Sport or Eco modes. The bakkie will also be available in 2 or 4-wheel drive. The 4×2 version is a rear-wheel drive, with drive being transmitted to the rear wheels via a longitudinal shaft and a differential located in the rear axle. As the load rests on the rear-drive wheels, the heavier the vehicle is loaded, the more traction it has. For 4×4 versions, the front transmission is engaged using a dedicated thumb-wheel to transmit some of the power to the front axle.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375719" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peugeot-landtrek1-e1582200623660.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375729" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peugeot-landtrek6-e1582200881976.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375731" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peugeot-landtrek7-e1582200979720.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375733" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peugeot-landtrek8-e1582200995184.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-375735" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Peugeot-landtrek9-e1582201024159.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-375699 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Landtrek-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Landtrek-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Landtrek-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Landtrek-4-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Peugeot said that the Landtrek has latest-generation comfort equipment from the brand’s SUVs, advanced connectivity (USB/Bluetooth sockets), automatic dual-zone air conditioning, 10″ HD touch screen compatible Apple CarPlay /Android Auto and a 10 GB hard drive.
