While larger enterprises and multi-nationals cut jobs in South Africa because of tougher economic conditions, SMEs in Africa can help resolve some of the continent’s most critical challenges by providing much-needed jobs, products and services, according to the Johannesburg Business School. “SMEs are the cornerstone of most economies as it accounts for about half of global gross domestic product (GDP) and 60%–70% of employment,” the business school said. World Bank data also found that SMEs contribute up to 60% of all employment and as much as 40% of the GDP in emerging economies. “In Africa, SMEs make up around two thirds of the continent’s formally employed workforce. While in South Africa, SMEs provide employment to roughly 47% of the workforce, with their total economic output accounting for around 20% of GDP,” said Johannesburg Business School.

To counter this threat, small businesses need to work together and support each other in order to create an environment where SMEs can thrive, create more jobs, and grow the economy. What many don’t realise is that by supporting the bigger multinational corporations, they unintentionally disable small business growth. This doesn’t support the growth of the continent’s local economy and does not contribute as much to the country’s GDP, leaving South African entrepreneurs and small businesses under the threat of globalisation. Further to this, when these multi-national corporations then downsize to increase profits, the country is left with mass unemployment. Not supporting SMEs only adds to the waning economic confidence levels which have been ascribed to the youth unemployment rate (which is above 60%), imminent large-scale job cuts in some key sectors and slow gross domestic product (GDP) growth, according to Mark Walker, associate VP for Sub-Saharan Africa at the IDC. It is with this in mind, coupled with a passion to build South Africa and be a part of growing the greater continent, that Founder and Managing Director at Joodle Technologies Dean Abrahams started his SME.
