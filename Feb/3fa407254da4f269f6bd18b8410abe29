In 2018 the Department of Transport and the Road Traffic Management Corporation (RTMC) launched the NaTIS online booking service, allowing Gauteng motorists to apply for their driver’s and vehicle licences online. While the online system has proved popular, a number of BusinessTech readers have complained that it has grown increasingly difficult to book a spot at their local licensing centre through the portal. The NaTIS website states that bookings are updated in real-time, with driving licensing testing centres opening new slots on a regular basis. Currently, these slots are opened at 07h45 on the following days: Ekhuruleni – Wednesday
Merafong – Monday
West Rand – Daily
Tshwane – Monday
Johannesburg – Tuesday
Mogale City – Daily
Sedibeng – Monday Speaking to BusinessTech, RTMC spokesperson Simon Zwane said that the organisation is ‘largely satisfied’ with the system but is constantly looking at how it is improved. He added that the RTMC takes into account customer comments and was aware of the difficulties some people were having in making bookings. “We are having continuous engagements with municipalities and provinces about the opening of slots. We are currently looking at a more workable solution to make more openings available.” Zwane added that the RTMC and government were in talks to further streamline the NaTIS system – including the ability to pay for licences, tests and other bookings ahead of time. “We want people to be able to pay online,” Zwane said. “Using these processes we want to make it very easy for people to use the system.” Read: 19 new bank branches where you can get your South African smart ID and passport in 2020
