A R1.2 billion solar farm has been approved by National Treasury for the Kannaland Municipality in the Garden Route District Municipality. The project will be a Public-Private Partnership between Kannaland Municipality and InnovSure to provide an alternative source of green energy to the municipality, the DA said in a statement on Thursday (6 February). The Kannaland Municipality is situated in the western part of the Little Karoo and includes the towns of Ladismith, Calitzdorp and Zoar. “This is (a) fantastic initiative as this investment will create job opportunities and the company will further invest R42 million per annum in the Kannaland Municipality for critical infrastructure projects and further assist the municipality with smart technology,” said Deidre Baartman, the Western Cape committee spokesperson on Finance, Economic Development, and Tourism. “Government cannot tackle the country’s energy crisis on its own. It is vital that we break down national government’s monopoly on energy generation and provision, and bring in the private sector to diversify this industry as a matter of urgency. The Kannaland solar farm is a prime example of this.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-371640 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kannaland.png" alt="" width="1289" height="851" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kannaland.png 1289w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kannaland-300x198.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kannaland-1024x676.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kannaland-768x507.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Kannaland-1200x792.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> During off-peak periods, the solar farm will also be able to draw energy from Eskom and release it during peak hours by means of storage capacity or wheel it to nearby municipalities such as Mossel Bay. “I will be monitoring this development closely to ensure that the Western Cape attains energy independence from Eskom to grow our provincial economy and create much-needed jobs,” said Baartman.
