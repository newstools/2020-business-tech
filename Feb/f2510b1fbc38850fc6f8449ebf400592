Most of South Africaâ€™s formal industries are regulated by strict and elaborate legislation. The repercussions of non-compliance with these laws could be devastating. The examples of companies brought to book for compliance-related offences in 2019 are plentiful. In September, MTN was fined R5 million by ICASA for not observing the required notice period when increasing the prices of a WhatsApp bundle. The following month, the Competition Commission slammed Computicket with a R20 million penalty for anti-competitive practices. Click here to learn more about Lexis Assure. Finally, December saw the South African Reserve Bank sanction a number of banks, including Standard Bank, for weaknesses in money laundering control. The Bank was slapped with a R30 million penalty. Big companies and entities are often able to absorb the costs of these fines, but this does not mean it has no effect on their bottom line. For smaller businesses the risk of non-compliance could be greater. Punishment through heavy fines or penalties for non-adherence are just the tip of the iceberg. Serious infringements may lead to the imprisonment of accountable board members, executives or managers. Additionally, a punished company stands to suffer losses in productivity or revenue, as well as reputational damage. All these factors could lead to the resignation or retrenchment of employees, and a loss of interest in the company from promising job candidates. Managing compliance is the responsibility of the compliance officer, whose work may further be complicated by the need to keep physical databases of legislation that may encompass mountains of documents.
