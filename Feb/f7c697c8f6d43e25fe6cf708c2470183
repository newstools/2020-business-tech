The Spur Corporation has warned that South Africa’s pizza franchise industry hs grown incredibly competitive, with consumers having a clear appetite for heavy discounts and good food. In a sales update for the six months ended December 2019, the group said it has been a bit of a struggle when it comes to pizza, with competition stiff, and price-points from competitors shrinking to stand out. “The pizza market in South Africa is extremely competitive with local quick-service restaurant brands discounting products significantly to maintain sales volumes. “Panarottis’ move away from significant discounting to maintain franchisee profitability and ensure the sustainability of the brand, combined with competitor activity, has impacted the brand’s turnover growth,” it said. This competition can be clearly seen in a recent BusinessTech poll, and readers have clear favourites when it comes to the pizza franchises they enjoy. In the poll of more than 600 readers, Roman’s Pizza is the current frontrunner with 29% of the votes. It was followed by Debonairs (22%) and Pizza Perfect (14%). Pizza is the third-largest fast-food category in South Africa, making up 21% of the over 5,000 fast food stores in the country. Below BusinessTech looked at some of the costs of opening a top pizza franchise in South Africa right now.

Interested applicants can complete a franchise form on its website. “Payment of an application fee/deposit in the sum of R6 900,00 (including Vat). Should your application be successful, the full amount of R6,900 (including Vat) will be credited to your set up costs. “In the event that your application is unsuccessful, regardless of the reason, you will be refunded R3,450 (including Vat). “We rely largely on our applicant franchisees to identify potential Andiccio24 sites and to forward the following information to us so that we can conduct a preliminary off-site assessment.” Some of the factors considered for a site include: The physical address of the premises;
