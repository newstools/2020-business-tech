Load shedding will be pushed to stage 3 on Saturday (15 February), and will be extended to 05h00 on Monday morning, Eskom says. This follows a loss of generating units on Friday evening, with the extra downtime needed to help replenish reserves. Eskom said that while some units have come back online, it used its open gas turbines and water pumps extensively overnight, and does not have adequate reserves to keep the lights on. Stage 3 load shedding will start from 09h00 on Saturday.
