Eskom says that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 21h00 tonight until 06h00 on Sunday (16 February) following the sudden loss of generating units. The group announced that it has lost four generating units, which combined with planned maintenance, has forced it onto emergency reserves. Eskom said while it regrets having to implement load shedding, and of the short notice, South Africans have been made aware of the strained system which is vulnerable to any negative situation. It warned earlier that the chances of load shedding this weekend were high. It said that South Africans should expect the risk of load shedding to persist for the next 18 months at the very least.
