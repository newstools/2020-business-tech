Balwin Properties has announced plans for a new R9 billion development in Waterfall, Midrand in Johannesburg. The development – called Munyaka – features a massive crystal-clear lagoon with apartments designed to be just metres from the waterfront. Balwin said it plans to sell one, two and three-bedroom apartments which are fibre-ready, includes a Scandinavian style kitchen, free eco-friendly appliances, a balcony for outdoor entertaining, and pre-paid water and electricity meters. Construction of the lagoon, boundary wall, gatehouse, lifestyle centre and show apartment block has already commenced with the balance of apartments being rolled out over the next eight years. “Munyaka, which translates to “Crystal” in Venda, is set to be the crown jewel in our development portfolio,” said Steve Brookes, founder and chief executive of Balwin Properties. “We have worked very closely with our architects to bring something exceptional to South African sectional title buyers and believe that it will not only set a new standard for lifestyle estate living in Waterfall, but indeed in the country.” Brookes said that Balwin is further investing significantly in road infrastructure around Munyaka, having already completed a new road at a cost in excess of R100 million. <img class="size-full wp-image-372252 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Munyaka-3.png" alt="" width="1030" height="799" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Munyaka-3.png 1030w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Munyaka-3-300x233.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Munyaka-3-1024x794.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Munyaka-3-768x596.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The Blyde Munyaka’s development follows the success of The Blyde in Pretoria East, the site of the first Crystal Lagoon amenity in sub-Sahara Africa. Balwin said it concluded an exclusivity agreement with Crystal Lagoons for South Africa, which will see the company develop freshwater lagoons in six strategic nodes in Johannesburg, Pretoria, the Dolphin Coast, the Western Cape and Mbombela. Crystal Lagoons is a multi-national company with offices worldwide and has developed an innovative concept and technology, patented in 190 countries, allowing for the construction and maintenance of unlimited size bodies of water, in crystal-clear conditions, at low cost. <img class="size-full wp-image-271575 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Blyde-Lagoon.jpg" alt="" width="960" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Blyde-Lagoon.jpg 960w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Blyde-Lagoon-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Blyde-Lagoon-768x576.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Blyde Lagoon pictured.

All residents at Munyaka will have access to the lagoon as well as a 6-star green rated VIP lifestyle centre with an on-site gym (free access), a spa, movie theatre, meeting rooms, restaurants, laundromats and concierge facilities. Access to these facilities will be biometrically controlled to add to the safety and security of residents, Balwin said. Free wifi will be made available at the lifestyle centre as well as around the beachfront area, where pergolas will offer phone charging facilities. “The support of the Waterfall Management Company has been outstanding in making this development a reality,” said Brookes. “Munyaka Crystalline Lagoon will have an important impact on the long-term sustainability of the Waterfall node and we look forward to our continued relationship, especially as we continue to develop road infrastructure in the area.” Read: It will cost you R250,000 to buy a parking spot at Cape Town’s new tallest building
