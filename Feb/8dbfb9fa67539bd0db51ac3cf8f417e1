Samsung has announced that Nedbank is the latest South African bank to join as a partner for Samsung Pay. The group announced at the Samsung Unpacked 2020 event that Nedbank has now joined its growing network of partners, allowing the bank’s customers to make use of the service for the first time. “Samsung Pay will go over 70% coverage of all the bank cards in South Africa,” the group said, in announcing the partnership with Nedbank.  Samsung launched its mobile payment app in South Africa in August 2018, following a brief early access period. Samsung Pay is a payment app which is available for selected Samsung Galaxy smartphones, allowing users to make card payments with their phone instead of their physical bank cards. The platform leverages a pair of useful technologies to facilitate these transactions – NFC and MST. At launch the service worked with Standard Bank and Absa bank cards, with FNB joining in March 2019. Other partners include RMB, Investec and Discovery Bank.
