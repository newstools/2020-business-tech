In addition, pre-opening costs associated with opening new stores, increased by 21.2%,” the group said.

Dion Wired At the start of January, Massmart said that it was in talks with unions about store closures and jobs cuts at Dion Wired. This includes a plan is to shutter the 23-store Dion-Wired chain and 11 Masscash wholesale outlets – impacting around 1,440 employees. While the group described these as ‘potential’ closures, it has said that the intention is to close the brand in the country. The closures are dependent on the outcome of the retrenchment process and consultations with unions, it said. Game Stores Also in January, Massmart announced a complete overhaul of its operations in South Africa, including big changed for its popular Game stores. In a shareholder presentation at the end of January, the company said that Game’s customer value proposition is currently unclear, with a lack of resonance in key growth segments. It added that there is a lack of coherence in its offering, an over-reliance on promotions, and certain segments – like fresh and frozen foods – which are just not working. Speaking to BusinessTech, Massmart corporate reputation manager Michelle Kemp said that Game will be focusing on its product assortment, specifically by focusing on the ranges that it is renowned for and introducing new lines, such as clothing. “We will be phasing out categories that have not been successful such as fresh and frozen food, and music and movies,” she said. “We are also focusing on improving our customer service levels, merchandise availability and general store standards. Our intention is to get the retail basics right so that customers have a much more pleasant shopping experience.” In the immediate term, Kemp said that Game is focused on strengthening categories that customers really enjoy – citing babies, multimedia and groceries. “In addition, we are bringing in clothing essentials. We have already started with a big focus on improving customer service, which is based on the Walmart happy-to-Help programme,” she said. Kemp said that Game would also focus on improving in-store execution and basic on-shelf standards. “Customers will see better, easier to shop price ticketing, on-shelf merchandising standards and much-improved availability of the products that they are looking for,” she said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-377605" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Massmart.png" alt="" width="820" height="796" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Massmart.png 820w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Massmart-300x291.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Massmart-768x746.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Massmart-50x50.png 50w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> On 30 January Massmart announced six turnaround interventions: Mitch Slape, who was appointed CEO of Massmart in September 2019, said: “Our Road to Recovery acknowledges that the core underlying business is strong and comprised of entrenched brands with high customer appeal.
