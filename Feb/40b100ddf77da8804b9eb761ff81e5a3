Mobile apps can help businesses in many ways, including with better customer relations, increased staff productivity, and improved client loyalty. With most economically-active people in South Africa using smartphones, it is now necessary for many businesses to have their own mobile apps to remain competitive. It is, however, expensive to get your own Android or iOS app. The typical cost to build a custom mobile app is anywhere from R400,000 to well over R1 million. In many cases a mobile website or web dashboard are excellent tools to communicate with clients and improve the operations of a company. Here, no mobile app is needed. However, if a company wants to increase its client stickiness, improve staff productivity on the road, or have a true smartphone presence, a mobile app is recommended. It should be noted that a mobile app will not magically improve operations, though. There must be a clear vision and purpose for the app and how it will fit into the company’s operations.
