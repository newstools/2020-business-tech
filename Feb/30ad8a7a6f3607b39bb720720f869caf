Eskom has moved to stage 2 load shedding after a recovery in generation performance on Saturday evening (15 February). The power utility said that it plans to continue with power cuts from 09h00 on Sunday (16 February) to help replenish reserves and better prepare for the coming week. “Implementing stage 3 load shedding during the night has helped us to reduce the usage of the emergency diesel reserves and to replenish the hydro-pumped storage scheme levels,” it said. “While the system has improved, we remind customers that should there be a change in the system and in the demand profile, the stage of load shedding may change at short notice.”  Load shedding schedules Customers can find their various load shedding schedules on their local metro or municipal websites, where applicable, or from Eskom directly.
