Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will continue until Friday (7 February), with a high probability of power cuts extending into the weekend. “Eskom regrets that owing to a shortage of capacity and a higher demand of about 2,000MW for electricity, stage 2 rotational load-shedding will continue tomorrow until Friday,” it tweeted on Wednesday evening (5 February). “There is also a high probability of load-shedding during the weekend.” Eskom also warned that the power cuts are set to continue for the next 18 months as it changes its maintenance plans. “We don’t take the decision to implement load-shedding lightly, but the reality is that our generating infrastructure is constrained and unreliable,” said Eskom CEO Andre de Ruyter. “It is regrettable for us to have to implement load-shedding, but it is unavoidable given the state of the generation infrastructure, as well as unusually high demand.”  The power utility said that it would also ‘continue to explore’ the possibility of lifting load shedding during peak traffic times. Eskom said this pilot project was heavily dependent on how much electricity is available and said that it would communicate when load shedding would be lifted on a daily basis.
