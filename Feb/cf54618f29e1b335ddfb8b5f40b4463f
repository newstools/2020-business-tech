Samsung recently unveiled its new Galaxy smartphones at its Unpacked 2020 event. The lineup of cutting-edge devices includes the Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra, as well as the foldable Galaxy Z Flip. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip sports a new form factor, departing from the Galaxy Fold’s vertical folding mechanism for a horizontally-folding clamshell design. The Galaxy S20, S20+, and S20 Ultra all support optional 5G connectivity, with the latter boasting a powerful camera with up to 100x zoom. To find out more about these powerful smartphones, read more below. The Galaxy Z Flip sports a clamshell folding design with the main display folding along its horizontal axis. This gives the device a much smaller form factor when closed, where notifications and other information is displayed on a smaller display on the outside of the device. The Galaxy Z Flip sports a main 6.7-inch OLED display with a resolution of 2,636 x 1,080 and a 1.06-inch 300 x 116 panel on the back. In terms of internal hardware, the Z Flip will ship with a Snapdragon 855+ processor, 8GB of RAM, 256GB of internal storage, and a 3,300mAh battery. The device’s operating system is optimised for its unique form factor, too, offering a number of tailored camera and notification features. Samsung’s Galaxy Z Flip is set to launch in South Africa on 22 February 2020 and will be priced at R29,999. The device will also be available on contract.
