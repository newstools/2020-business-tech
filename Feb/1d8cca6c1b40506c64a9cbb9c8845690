The Department of Home Affairs (DHA) will roll out Smart ID and Passport facilities to several more bank branches in 2020. The DHA launched Smart ID cards in 2013. These cards are a modern alternative to green ID books – which will eventually be phased out – and offer automated identity verification. They boast a contactless chip and advanced security features including public and symmetric-key encryption. The E-Home Affairs system was launched in 2016 and lets South Africans apply and pay for their card or a passport on the Home Affairs website. Applicants can then collect their card or passport at a Home Affairs office or the nearest supported bank branch that offers a Home Affairs Live Capture Service. Once a card or passport is ready for collection, it can be picked up at one of these bank branches. Users will need to provide biometric authentication to receive their documents. The process saves citizens the trouble of waiting in long queues at a Home Affairs office, where this type of task can be more time-consuming. Currently, the E-Home Affairs branches are available at 16 bank locations across the country, most of which are in Gauteng. MyBroadband spoke to South Africa’s major banks, which confirmed that 19 new locations will be added in the coming months.

These are expected to be completed during the course of the year, she said. The branches where the service will be rolled out are Rosebank Mall, Menlyn Maine, Key West, Claremont, Stellenbosch, Waterfall Mall, Woodlands, Pinetown, Fourways Mall, and Randburg. Mlhantla said the bank’s customers are embracing the service. “Although only four branches are currently operational, the branches process roughly 1,000 smart card applications per month and around 1,200 passport applications on average,” Mlhlanta said.

It said customers are generally positive and appreciate the convenience of the service. The bank said the service was particularly popular with first-time ID applicants and passport seekers. “Usage numbers do vary depending on whether it is during a school holiday period or not. Numbers vary between 30 and 70 applications per day per site.” Standard Bank <img class="size-full wp-image-198066 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Standard-Bank-logo-5.png" alt="" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Standard-Bank-logo-5.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Standard-Bank-logo-5-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Standard Bank spokesperson Ross Linstrom said the bank will open five more branches which offer SmartID and Passport services.
