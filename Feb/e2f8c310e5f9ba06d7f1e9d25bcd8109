Data analytics group Lightstone and Tracker have published a new report on the towns which recorded the highest increase in activity over the December festive period. The data covers a large portion of Tracker-fitted vehicles from across the country (on an aggregated and anonymised level) to determine which areas show the highest increase in volume of traffic. Lightstone found that areas in the Limpopo region made up 9 of the top 10 towns that experienced the largest inflow of ‘going home’ traffic with Polokwane taking the top spot followed by Collins Chabane, then Makhado. <img class="size-full wp-image-371256 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-2.jpg" alt="" width="1181" height="710" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-2.jpg 1181w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-2-300x180.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-2-1024x616.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-2-768x462.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “We looked at the coastal holiday traffic from two perspectives: 1- which towns gained the most visitors, and 2- how much this was percentage-wise compared to the November activity. Both perspectives tell part of a bigger story,” said Linda Reid, head of commercial property at Lightstone. “For example, a large town could have an influx of many people but relative to its out-of-season size, that growth may not be as radical as that of a smaller town populated by fewer people that doubles in size.” The beach towns with the highest increase in activity compared to their November averages are Struisbaai at a 358% increase, Stilbaai at a 331% increase, followed by Southbroom on the South Coast of Kwa-Zulu Natal at a 310%. When looking at the highest inflow of visitors, Plettenberg Bay and Mossel Bay take the number one and two spots respectively with activity in these areas doubling when compared to their November positions. <img class="size-full wp-image-371254 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone.png" alt="" width="1744" height="955" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone.png 1744w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-300x164.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-1024x561.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-768x421.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-1536x841.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/Lightstone-1200x657.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: 3 Schengen visa changes that South Africans need to know about
