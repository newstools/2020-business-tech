Event ticketing and cashless platform, Howler, says it has secured a second round of growth capital investment from three partner companies, namely Techstars, Platform Investment Partners Growth (Platform Growth) and Platform45. Howler said it is on a significant growth trajectory having enjoyed its busiest event season ever this past December servicing over 400 events. “The Series B round has been raised in order to further develop Howler’s end-to-end event technology stack, grow market share in Sub-Saharan Africa, and to expand into Europe and APAC,” it said. “Being our second round of investment, this is really significant for Howler for many reasons,” said Shai Evian, co-founder and CEO of Howler. “In 2017 we were licensing our tech and had a team of about 25 people in the company. Back then, Techstars really helped us shape a vision and put us on a different trajectory. With Platform Growth’s first investment round and Platform45 as a development partner, we are two and a half years down the line, 70 people strong and have managed to develop and own 100% of our entire platform,” Evian said. Investment from these three companies brings value to Howler from multiple avenues, including software development, funding and access to a global network of likeminded entrepreneurs. “We are doubling down on our technology to create a more seamless and connected event experience for all our stakeholders, event organisers and event goers. I don’t believe there is another South African company investing this much into the space like we are,” Evian said. Read: 9 innovative South African businesses to watch in 2018
