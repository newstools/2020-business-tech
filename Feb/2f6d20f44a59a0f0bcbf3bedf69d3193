The University of Cape Town has added 10 new high-tech patrol vehicles to the university’s Campus Protection Services (CPS) fleet. The branded vehicles will operate on UCT’s campus and its fringes and will patrol strategic routes to maintain visibility and allow CPS officers quicker response times to any potential incidents. The officers will also continue to patrol other areas across campus to maintain maximum visibility. To ensure that the operating officers adhere to the CPS strategic deployment plan, the vehicles have been fitted with tracking devices, and all vehicles will be equipped with an electronic patrol device to ensure that certain critical areas are checked regularly. “These new vehicles will certainly make us more visible and increase our response capability to criminal and medical incidents,” said Don Smith, CPS manager.  <img class="size-full wp-image-371112 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UCT-2.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="533" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UCT-2.jpg 800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UCT-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/UCT-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Further fittings and equipment will include dash cameras to record patrolled areas, and equipment to deal with medical emergencies, minor fires, traffic control in the event of accidents, and other potentially dangerous situations students and staff might face. CPS officers on foot patrol, for whom these vehicles will also be critical support components, will undergo training to deal with all types of incidents and emergencies that may occur. CPS said it also plans to install licence plate recognition cameras to these vehicles. Read: New SARS technology to go after tax-dodging South Africans
