Minister of Transport, Fikile Mbalula, has gazetted the new toll tariffs for 2020. The gazette outlines the fees for toll roads across the country which are set to come into effect on 1 March 2020. The gazette also includes the fees schedule for the controversial Gauteng Freeway Improvement Project (GFIP) – also known as e-tolls. E-tolls have met with resistance from road users since inception in 2013, leading to non-payment by many, and calls to scrap the system altogether. At the end of last year however, finance minister Tito Mboweni said that the system cannot be scrapped unless a replacement revenue source is found. Mboweni said that financing the GFIP is done on a corporate finance basis and not a project finance basis. This means that borrowing for toll roads is done on the basis that there is a revenue stream to finance the debt, he said. “A significant portion of the South African National Roads Agency’s existing debt was to finance the upgrade of roads on GFIP and it requires a revenue stream to finance it, so e-tolls cannot be abolished without a revenue stream to finance existing commitments.” In November, Transport minister Fikile Mbalula said that cabinet has not made an official decision on the future of e-tolls.
