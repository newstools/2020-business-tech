Uber users in South Africa will have the option of receiving a four-digit PIN code to provide to their driver before starting a trip. The ride-sharing company said that the new safety feature will begin rolling out this week and will introduce an added layer of verification to ensure users get into the right vehicle. Users can opt-in to the PIN code feature by navigating to their app settings and tapping ‘verify your ride. From there, users can choose to use the PIN verification feature on every trip or only during evening trips (21h00 – 18h00) . Once enabled, the user will receive a four-digit PIN code in their app while the driver is en-route to the pickup location. When the driver arrives, the users can verbally provide the PIN to the driver before getting into the vehicle. After the driver enters the correct PIN, the trip can begin. When the feature is enabled, a trip cannot start until the correct PIN is entered into the driver’s app. “This opt-in safety feature will help to ensure that users are getting into the correct Uber before the trip begins, said Uber country manager Nduduzo Nyanda. “It is a great example of how tech can help make travel safer than ever before, and will support our efforts to continue to prevent incidents as we work to set the standard for ride-sharing safety.” Read: New report shows how Uber’s surge pricing works in South Africa
