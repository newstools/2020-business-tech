The Department of Justice and Constitutional Development and the National Treasury have launched a Covid-19 procurement spend dashboard detailing government’s procurement spend during the coronavirus pandemic. The dashboard follows a directive issued by president Cyril Ramaphosa to organs of state in August 2020 for the submission of full information regarding Covid-19 procurement. The National Treasury has since issued further instruction to the organs of state compelling institutions to report on the Covid-19 spend using a standard predefined format which will allow more details and data to be shared with the members of the public. Treasury said that the dashboard provides more details regarding the previously published reports. It is  categorised as follows: Report summary: Summary of the information submitted;
Item spend: Indicates how much was spent on a particular item by an organ of state;
Supplier details: Lists total order amount received by the supplier;
Supplier analysis: Lists all director names for the suppliers;
Submission details: Provides a list of all transaction submitted allowing downloading and further analysis. “The dashboard provides information regarding the actual commodity purchased, the quantities and price per item,” Treasury said. “It enables filtering the data per supplier across all organs of state that reported, this includes the actual items that have been bought (e.g., face mask, etc.) and total order amounts.” Treasury said that the data transparency has also been improved by listing the names of the directors of companies that have provided Covid-19 related goods, services or works. “The data will be regularly updated as and when organs of state provide reports and there is a requirement for all organs of state to report on their procurement spend monthly which will be published,” it said.
