External devices such as monitors, multifunction printers, speakers, microphones and cameras will therefore need to be considered. Below is an overview of the devices available from BCX. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-370651" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BCX-Devices.jpg" alt="BCX Devices" width="640" height="430" /> BCX provides several secure cloud-based applications as well as software licensing fit for your organisation’s productivity needs. If you have a contact centre and now require agents to effectively work remotely, you may need to extend your call centre infrastructure with cloud-based telephony solutions.

As more workers become mobile, they are no longer protected at the perimeter. Remote workers might be required to work via VPNs in order to access shared resources on main servers, which can have an impact on network speeds and device performance. Proper security protocols must be addressed to protect the information being accessed away from your physical site, including provisions for VPN security, antivirus software and endpoint protection. BCX offers active protection to detect a wide range of attacks from a variety of threats, including APTs, DDoS, zero-day malware and insider threats. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-370647" src="https://mybroadband.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/BCX-Security.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="430" /> BCX provides remote technical assistance for devices to resolve any issues irrespective of location.
