Audi has announced local pricing and availability for its new Audi A4 in South Africa. “The A4 represents the core of the Audi brand – after four years in the making, the successful midsize Sedan is now tauter, sportier and more intelligent than before. “Its exterior has evolved into Audi’s new design language and the introduction of the large MMI touch display offers the kind of operating experience that customers will be familiar with from their smartphone,” it said in a statement. The new Audi A4 is the brand’s first model to usher in fully integrated connectivity functions with Audi connect. “The engine options now come with a mild-hybrid system (MHEV) which allows for efficiency and comfort from broad-based electrification. “This combination of advanced design, new technology, an efficient and connected driving experience, makes the product improvement on the Audi A4 quite a substantial package in the premium B-Sedan segment.” Audi said that the midsize model has sportier design highlights. The Singleframe grille is now broader and flatter; horizontal lines emphasize the width at the front and rear. “The side view is defined by the distinctive muscles above the fenders and the lower set shoulder line in between. They form strong contours above the wheels and make the Quattro genes outwardly visible.” LED headlights now come standard in the Audi A4 and are available in different variations. The 35 TFSI features low beam, high beam and daytime running lights in LED technology. The 40 TFSI and S4 will feature a higher version of LED including a different daytime running light design and dynamic indicators for the rear; also available optionally is the top-of-the-line Matrix LED headlights with fully automatic high beam. The equipment line concept is equally new: standard, Advanced and S line are now available for the exterior, not to mention the independent look of the S model with the standard high gloss styling package to accentuate its exterior look. Customers can choose from 12 paint colours, including a new Terra Grey colour option, Audi said. For wheel options, 17” size is configured as standard on the entry Trimline and an 18” standard wheel size on the Advanced and S line trims. There is an option to upgrade to 19” for a further sportier look. The Audi S4 offers 19” wheels as standard with a choice of three designs. In the centre of the instrument panel, slightly tilted toward the driver, is the large and new MMI touch display, the control centre for the new operating system. Interior customisation to standard seating is available in a variety of leather/leatherette colour combinations. With its new MMI system, the Audi A4 offers a user experience similar to a contemporary smartphone, Audi said. An MMI touch display with acoustic feedback replaces the functions of the previous rotary/pushbutton control on the centre tunnel console. The high-resolution TFT display measures 10.1 inches. “The natural-language voice control, another function of the new system, understands many of the phrases used in everyday speech,” Audi said. “Audi Connect takes the comfort, enjoyment and safety of driving the new Audi A4 to a whole new level. The technology focuses on integrating the structures that use online connectivity with the vehicle, to provide real-time information and multiple digital functions. “This includes delivering internet services to the car via an embedded sim (installed directly into the vehicle) and used through the myAudi app. When inside the vehicle, the Audi MMI (multimedia interface) and Audi virtual cockpit becomes the mechanic of use.” Safety and service features will support the driver in the event of damage, breakdown or minor accidents. This enables an emergency call or roadside assistance directly from the vehicle in order to access emergency towing, ambulance, police or fire brigade support. Notification of when a service is due is also integrated into the functionality and will trigger an automatic prompt to the registered Audi Dealer. The drive system Audi will be offering the A4 model line with three turbocharged engines in South Africa. Their power outputs range from 110 kW to 260 kW – from the Audi A4 35 TFSI up to the Audi S4 TFSI. For the market launch in October 2020, two engine variants (A4 35 TFSI and 40 TFSI) will feature a mild-hybrid system (MHEV) based on 12 volts, which reduces fuel consumption while improving comfort. This broad-based electrification makes an important contribution to achieving positive fuel consumption. In everyday use, the MHEV system reduces fuel consumption by up to 0.3 litres per 100 kilometres according to individual Audi measurements. All A4 models come off the production line with an automatic transmission as standard. The range is expected to include a diesel engine in quarter one of 2021. The Audi S4 TFSI The 3.0 TFSI offering follows from the previous generation Audi S4. It combines sports car performance with good levels of efficiency and also impresses with high power, ample torque, spontaneous response and a sonorous sound. The direct petrol injection engine with turbocharging has an output of 260 kW and produces a torque of 500 Nm from 1,370 to 4,500 rpm. The turbo V6 engine accelerates the Audi S4 from 0 to 100 km/h in 4.7 seconds, and up to an electronically governed top speed of 250 km/h. In the new S4, a fast and smoothly shifting eight-speed tiptronic handles the power transfer. “Its lower gears have short, sporty ratios, while the upper gears are long to reduce revs and fuel consumption,” Audi said. The quattro permanent all-wheel drive makes a large contribution to the sporty handling of the S4. In normal driving, it distributes engine forces with a slight emphasis of the rear wheels – if necessary the majority of forces can be directed to the axle with better traction. Local packages The new Audi A4 range will offer the package concept as introduced on other new models launched in South Africa.
