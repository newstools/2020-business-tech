Online retailer Takealot has confirmed that its annual Blue Dot Sale will return for Black Friday 2020. While Black Friday is an American tradition, local retailers have adopted it in large numbers. Black Friday is particularly popular among e-commerce players and is now the biggest online shopping day in South Africa. Takealot said that the sale will launch sometime in November and that 1,000s of products will be on sale across 28 different departments, including deals on: Tech products;
Home and kitchen products;
Leisure, sport and toy deals;
Everyday essential items;
Media deals. Takelaot said that its Blue Dot Sale isn’t just a one-day sale and that hundreds of new deals will be added daily. It said that shoppers can also expect savings on Cyber Monday and Takealot Tuesday. The group said it will also offer a number of exclusive deals through its mobile app. “With hundreds of new deals added daily, there’s never been a better way to shop TVs, toys, phones, fragrances, gaming and more,” Takealot said. “Remember to download the Takealot App for exclusive app-only deals before anyone else! Choose from many safe and easy ways to pay, including cash on delivery and credit card, and get your order delivered to straight to your door anywhere in South Africa.” You can find the Blue Dot Sale website here, although none of the deals are currently live.
