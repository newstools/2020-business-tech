President Cyril Ramaphosa presented his economic reconstruction and recovery plan for South Africa to parliament on Thursday (15 October), laying out the government’s plan to help restore South Africa’s economy after the coronavirus pandemic. In a series of documents published alongside Ramaphosa’s presentation, government outlined some measures for the recovery plan, as well as broad timeframes for the changes. One of the key interventions is the creation and support of 875,000 jobs in the 2020/21 financial year, increasing further in 2021/22 and 2022/23. Below are some of the areas government said it will be focusing and hiring to meet this target. 50,000 new opportunities in environmental programmes and 14,000 new opportunities in community forestry;
25,000 new opportunities in labour-intensive municipal infrastructure maintenance;
1,560 new opportunities in facilities maintenance, water and energy efficiency, and construction of rural bridges;
37,097 new opportunities in rural roads maintenance;
5,531 new opportunities in community health work;
32,663 new opportunities for public employment in cities;
300,000 opportunities for teaching and school assistants and the protection of 44,933 vulnerable teaching posts;
Expansion of the Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) incentive to create 8,000 jobs in global business services. Ramaphosa has also pledged to support a number of sectors which were hit hard by the coronavirus lockdown. These sectors include: Supporting 74,626 small-scale farmers to expand production and access markets;
Support for 34,070 livelihoods in the creative, cultural and sporting sector (including grant funding and protection of vulnerable posts in cultural institutions);
Support to 5,000 young entrepreneurs and micro-enterprises;
Support for 111,142 livelihoods in early childhood development. Large-scale job interventions driven by the state and social partners have proven effective in many countries that have faced devastation from wars and other crises, Ramaphosa said in his presentation on Thursday. “We have committed R100 billion over the next three years to create jobs through public and social employment as the labour market recovers. “This starts now, with over 800,000 employment opportunities created in the months ahead. The employment stimulus is focused on those interventions that can be rolled out most quickly and have the greatest impact on economic recovery,” he said.
