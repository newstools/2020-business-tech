Online store OneDayOnly has announced that it will offer a full week of deals as part of its Black Friday sale. The daily deal provider will run deals throughout the week leading up to Black Friday, building up to 100% off deals on the Friday (27 November) itself, said creative director Matthew Leighton. In addition, on every Tuesday and Thursday for the month of November, OneDayOnly will be running highly discounted sales campaigns, Leighton said. OneDayOnly said that shoppers can expect deals on ‘anything and everything’ during the period. “There will be a strong focus on tech, apparel and homeware, as well as some big brands across all categories, but this is what makes OneDayOnly so exciting: there will be deals on almost everything you can think of,” said Leighton. “As has been the case for most of the year, extreme care will be taken when it comes to logistics and deliveries. There is and will continue to be a strong focus on the safety of our employees, the couriers, and of course our customers.” Leighton said that OneDayOnly also plans to offer deals at up to 100% off as it did during Black Friday 2019. “It’s worth mentioning that there will be special app-only 100% off deals on Black Friday. The only way to access those: make sure you have the OneDayOnly app downloaded before then,” he said. Read: Here are Game’s Black Friday 2020 plans – including 1 cent deals
