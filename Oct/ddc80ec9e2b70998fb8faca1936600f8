Content marketing is the most trusted form of online advertising in South Africa, and is the most effective form of native advertising. This is according to the 2020 South African Business Marketing Report, which is based on feedback from local business decision makers. The main form of content marketing is sponsored articles, which allow a business to speak to potential customers and existing clients in a trusted and comprehensive format. Sponsored articles also blend in well with their host platform – such as a news website – and exhibit a professional look and feel. Additionally, sponsored articles have the benefit of built-in audience targeting, as the content will only appeal to the market it is aimed at. This can be enhanced further with audience targeting across social media channels, specifically Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn. It is for this reason that BusinessTech developed its sponsored article marketing product – which delivers an advertising message in this highly-trusted format. A BusinessTech sponsored article consists of the following elements: Headline – A strong headline which grabs the attention of your target audience.
Headline Image – An image which represents the message you want to convey.
Article Body – The article copy, which will educate and inform readers.
URLs/UTMs – Links to a company website, product listing, lead form, or contact page, which allows customers to contact you.
