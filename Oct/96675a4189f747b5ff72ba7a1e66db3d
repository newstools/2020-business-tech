Veteran motoring journalist Malcolm Kinsey has released his Kinsey report for 2020 – detailing how much it costs to service and repair some of South Africa’s most popular bakkies. Kinsey said most of his research was previously undertaken in and around Durban, with him personally handing in parts lists to local dealers to complete. However, he said that this year he approached a few manufacturers to supply their retail prices including VAT – which he then randomly checked at dealerships. The double-cab bakkie category is split according to the prices for parts needed during servicing, for repairs and as a result of crashes. Six vehicles were included in this year’s report: Ford Ranger 2.0 D XLT
GWM Steed 6 2.0 VGT Xcape
Toyota Hilux 2.8 GD Lgd Auto
Nissan Navara 2.2. DS E Auto
Isuzu D-Max 30 TD LX Auto
Ford Ranger Raptor 2.0 T <img class="aligncenter wp-image-444692" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kinsey-bakkie.png" alt="" width="1200" height="1015" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kinsey-bakkie.png 874w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kinsey-bakkie-300x254.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Kinsey-bakkie-768x649.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Kinsey’s data shows that the Ford Ranger XLT wins the category with a total parts basket price of R79,796. The GWM Steed 6 places second, one place up from last year and boasting a lower price parts basket of R86,105. Third is the Toyota Hilux at R90,189, followed closely by the Nissan Navara at R93,969.
