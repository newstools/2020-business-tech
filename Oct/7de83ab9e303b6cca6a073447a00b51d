The Shoprite Group has launched its new Xtra Savings rewards programme for its stores. The new Shoprite Xtra Savings card will benefit customers with immediate cash savings and launches a year after the Checkers Xtra Savings rewards programme, the group said. Shoprite said that more than five million customers have signed up for its Checkers rewards programme, which has put more than a R1 billion back in the pocket of consumers through savings and discounts in the last year. Customers are increasingly looking for value after the lockdown restrictions have put household income under pressure, said Neil Schreuder, chief of strategy and innovation for the Shoprite Group. “The success of Xtra Savings is its simplicity and transparency. No points and no levels, it’s all about straight-forward instant savings on things you actually need,” he said. How it works Shoprite Xtra Savings customers will receive instant discounts of up to 40% off on everyday essentials – such as a saving of R70 on two packs of 2kg Sunlight washing powder. Added benefits include free airtime and savings on combo deals, which are applied automatically at the till. Shoprite said that shoppers can sign up for Xtra Savings for free in under 60 seconds via any of the following channels: WhatsApp (add (+27 87 240 5709 as a contact and say “Hi!”);
USSD (simply dial *134*569*CARDNUMBER#);
Online (visit shoprite.co.za);
In-store. The group said that Xtra Savings cards can be used interchangeably at both Shoprite and Checkers branded stores – although they are only applicable to the respective brand’s promotions and discounts. <span style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" data-mce-type="bookmark" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Read: Here’s why your credit score is so important – and how to improve it
