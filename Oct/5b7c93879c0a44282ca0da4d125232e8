Emirates has entered into an agreement with regional airline Airlink as part of a major expansion in South Africa. Emirates’ agreement with Airlink will provide customers enhanced connectivity via Johannesburg and Cape Town to more than 25 domestic destinations in South Africa and more than 20 regional destinations in Southern Africa. Emirates and Airlink will offer single-ticket travel and one-stop baggage check-in for customers transferring from Johannesburg and Cape Town to domestic points including Bloemfontein, George, Upington, Nelspruit, Hoedspruit and Port Elizabeth, as well as points across Southern Africa like Gaborone, Kasane, Vilanculos, Maun, Victoria Falls, Maputo, Windhoek, Harare, Lusaka, Ndola, Bulawayo and Livingstone amongst many others. Customers can book their travel with both airlines online at Emirates, through online travel agencies as well as with local travel agents. “Emirates is pleased to partner with Airlink on a new interline agreement that will help us strengthen our presence and give customers more choice, flexibility and enhanced connections across 45 cities in Southern Africa. “We are committed to our operations in South Africa, as we continue to look at ways to build our extended network for customers, and help them benefit with diverse travel options,” said Sir Tim Clark, president of Emirates Airline. “The interline agreement that has gone into effect with Airlink is only the start of further collaboration, and we are looking forward to exploring more opportunities to widen the scope of our partnership in the future.” Emirates resumed its operations into Johannesburg and Cape Town on 1 October, and Durban on 8 October, with enhanced safety measures in place across all of its onboard and on ground touchpoints. The airline said that it continues to build market demand through connecting customers via Dubai from close to 100 destinations, as well as building more connection opportunities in South Africa through partnerships with airlines like Airlink.
