Western Cape premier Alan Winde says the province will introduce a new ‘blue dot system’ for taxis as part of its provincial coronavirus recovery plan. Winde said that the system follows the successful implementation of the red dot taxi service which aimed to create a safe public transport system for healthcare workers and for those being transported to and from quarantine and isolation facilities. The red dot taxi service is delivered by a fleet of almost 200 dedicated minibuses, each fitted with a protective screen between the driver and passengers, a tracker to monitor performance and the recognisable red sticker. “Since its launch, the service has completed over 110,000 health worker trips and over 11,400 quarantine and isolation trips. “We worked with the taxi industry in the province to ensure that the service they offered was safe- with taxis being regularly sanitised, load numbers managed and a protective screen placed between drivers and passengers.” Winde said that the province now plans to introduce a similar system blue sticker system which will identify trustworthy drivers. “The blue Dot Service will provide monthly incentives to taxi operators and drivers to provide good service and to operate safely. We will use technology and a five-star rating system to track performance against set targets,” he said. “We intend to roll out the first phase in this financial year, using the Department of Transport and Public Works own resources. ” Winde said that service will first launch in the Cape Town metro, in partnership with taxi council Santaco, and will work with up to 1,000 drivers and operators on priority routes. “Two-thirds of the province’s commuters currently rely on taxis and the Blue Dot system will help us to improve the service commuters receive, and create a safer experience, while also supporting jobs in the industry,” he said.
