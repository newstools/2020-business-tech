Renewable power company Lekela has announced the start of commercial operations at its Perdekraal East windfarm in the Western Cape. The windfarm will add 110MW to South Africa’s national grid and is the first wind farm from round four of the renewable energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme to begin commercial operations. It commenced its 20-year Commercial Operations period starting Thursday, 8 October 2020. Situated in the Witzenberg Municipality near Matjiesfontien in the Western Cape, Perdekraal East has 48 turbines generating approximately 360 GWh of energy each year – enough to supply power for 111,000 South African homes. <img class="wp-image-439217 size-large aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-439229 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="600" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2-300x94.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2-1024x320.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2-768x240.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2-1536x480.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Perdekraal-2-1200x375.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> It has a 20-year power purchase agreement with Eskom. Lekela co-owns the project with the local community which has a shareholding though a community trust. “Every renewable project which reaches completion means South Africa gains more advantage from its abundant sustainable resources,” said Lekela Power chief executive Chris Antonopoulos. “More vital power flows into the national grid with all the concomitant benefits for the country and its citizens.” Antonopoulos said that the facility will eliminate approximately 410,000 tons of CO2 emissions annually compared to traditional fossil-fuel power-plants.  He added that the 140MW Kangnas windfarm in the Northern Cape will reach its commercial operations date later in the year. It will use 61 turbines, each producing 2.3MW to add around another 500 GWh each year of clean, economic and renewable energy to the national grid. Perdekraal East and Kangnas will join Lekela Power’s three other South African operations already in operation: its 80MW Noupoort, 140MW Loeriesfontein 2, and 140MW Khobab windfarms, all in the Northern Cape. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-439237 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2.jpg 2000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-439241" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-4.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="1599" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-4.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-4-225x300.jpg 225w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-4-768x1023.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-4-1153x1536.jpg 1153w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-439239 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Oil and gas company Shell to cut up to 9,000 jobs
