CareerJunction has published its latest monthly jobs index for September 2020, showing which job skills are currently the most sought-after in South Africa. The CareerJunction Index (CJI) represents online labour dynamics in South Africa by providing a detailed analysis of the relative ratio of supply and demand in the online job market. The CJI is based on comprehensive data gathered from the CareerJunction website. According to CareerJunction, hiring activity increased by 4% during September, while job search activity increased by 12%. Demand has increased for professionals in the business & management, sales, warehousing & logistics, manufacturing & assembly, admin, office & support and architecture & engineering. The CJI settled at 91 index points, indicating increased competition in the job search market. An index score below 100 indicates that there are fewer job opportunities for potential job seekers and more potential job seekers per job advert. Recruitment is easier due to more potential job seekers per job advert in this market. A score above 100, meanwhile, implies the opposite – that there are more job opportunities for potential job seekers, and fewer potential job seekers per job advert. Recruitment under these conditions is more difficult, due to less potential job seekers per job advert. The index is down significantly from a year ago, and follows a muted period of job search activity due to the Covid-19 pandemic and lockdown, which almost froze hiring activity across all sectors for months. However, as the economy has again opened up, companies are looking for skills to aid in recovery – though this is still in a limited capacity. In-demand job skills The job skills that are highly sought-after locally continues the trend seen over the last year – even during the Covid-19 pandemic. Software development skills remain in highest demand. Hiring activity for software developers increased by 10% during September 2020, the group said. Managerial staff is highly demanded in the South African job market. Sales managers and finance managers are particularly well sought after. Demand for sales consultants is slowly growing and increased by 16% during September, CareerJunction said.
