Toyota has launched the latest iteration of its popular Hilux bakkie in South Africa, building on the Legend 50 model which was introduced in 2019. A number of models have been consolidated and updated for the 2020 range to keep up with market trends, Toyota said. The largest change is in the ‘mid-range’ where the SRX is replaced by the Raider. “The SRX model has continuously evolved in line with market requests. SRX and Raider have now effectively merged, creating an opportunity for a flagship-grade above Raider –precisely what the new Legend grade offers,” said Glenn Crompton, vice-president of marketing. Toyota said that the most visible change on the new Hilux model is in the front, with new slim-line headlamps flanking an all-new front-grille and bumper design. <img class="size-full wp-image-438839 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-438841 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-438843 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Hilux-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The 2.8 GD-6 engine delivers 150kW and 500Nm (Auto).
