Four years since announcing the Umhlanga Arch concept, the first phase of the development is now complete and open for business. The development first broke ground in October 2017, planned as a joint venture between The Multiply Group and Devmco Group. As of 6 October 2020, the first phase of the build has been officially launched. It welcomes residents into smart-ready apartments, while the Legacy Yard and Backyard is open to visitors. The development has a AAA-grade status, and also introduced South Africa’s first flagship Hilton Garden Inn. The European-inspired high street will have a number of bespoke, local retailers open shop, namely fashion and jewellery stores Amanda Ferri, Mark Gold, Holiday Harbour, Breazies and The Gentry; as well as beauty and wellness specialists Hello Hunny, Skin Renewal and the Moustache Barbershop. “This is the moment we have all been waiting for and we can’t wait to welcome homeowners and the public to what has become one of South Africa’s most iconic developments to enter the property market,” said Mark Rosenberg, Umhlanga Arch visionary and executive partner of Multiply Group. Within the first two months of development, Umhlanga Arch had curated 400 permanent jobs, thereafter the numbers peaked at 1,300 individuals working on the site everyday throughout most of 2018, 2019 and into 2020 up until Covid-19 lockdown in March 2020. Work resumed in June 2020 with 1,100 workers onsite daily. “This R1.3 billion development has far-reaching effects in bolstering tourism, stimulating investment into the region, further elevating Umhlanga and greater Durban to a world-class standing, and has already facilitated significant job creation to date,” said Rosenberg. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-439587" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Umhlanga-Arch-04.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="628" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Umhlanga-Arch-04.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Umhlanga-Arch-04-300x157.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Umhlanga-Arch-04-1024x536.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Umhlanga-Arch-04-768x402.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />
