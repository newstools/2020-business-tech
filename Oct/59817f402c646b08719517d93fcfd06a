Marks Building,
National Assembly,
Old Assembly kitchens <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> The proposed renovations have largely been criticised by the committe on the financial managment of parliament, with MPs pointing to the exorbitant costs as well as the necessity of security measures such as ‘anti-ramming devices’. The committee also criticised the unnecessary delay of the projects that have been on the cards for some time, the fact that some of the projects are unnecessary, and the escalation of cost due to the delays. Speaker of the National Assembly, Thandi Modise, said that parliament was not going to spend ‘R25 million refurbishing kitchens’ in her name, She further scolded the department over the sideling of parliament in discussions around the refurbishments.  “The department should not tell parliament what its needs are, but should respond to the needs that parliament had identified,” she said. “Parliament can’t be told by the department, for example, to fit an alarm that is unnecessary or unnecessarily replace a gate. We need to participate, not to be informed,” said Modise. She said parliament must take over its maintenance budget and that managing its own facilities would require knowledgeable facilities management that must include expertise about how to manage heritage buildings.
