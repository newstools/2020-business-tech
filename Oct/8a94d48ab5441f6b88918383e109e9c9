Woolworths has confirmed that it will again be participating in Black Friday this year, with the retailer offering promotions during the period in Fashion, Beauty, Home and Food across stores, online and its app. A spokesperson said that Woolworths plans to have strict social distancing protocols in stores for employees and customers, including limiting the number of people allowed into the store at one time. “We encourage our customers to shop online and have their purchases delivered to their homes. “We will have a strong online offering and we’re currently scaling our operations in preparation for the rush, for example we’re adding more pickers, couriers and slots, to make ensure that you can shop all your favourite items online.” The group said that its Woolies App now has over one million customers and one of the features that will be key during the period is the ability to check if your local store has the product you want in stock. This will ensure that customers are able to plan their trips to stores which should assist in maintaining social distancing. “We have many more surprises for our customers over the whole Christmas trading period so watch this space.” While Black Friday is an American tradition, local retailers have adopted it in large numbers. Black Friday is particularly popular among e-commerce players and is now the biggest online shopping day in South Africa. The shopping day will fall on 27 November in 2020.
