Eskom says that load shedding will continue until further notice – with no stop time or date on the cards for now. The group implemented stage 4 load shedding on Tuesday due to further losses in generating capacity, after unit 1 at the Koeberg power station tripped due to a fault. This was reduced to stage 2 overnight, as demand decreased, but then ramped back up to stage 4 on Wednesday morning. This trend is expected to continue, without being suspended, until further notice, Eskom said. “Eskom will continue implementing stage 4 load shedding until further notice. We expect that load shedding, at various stages, may continue into the weekend,” it said. “We are expecting some generation units to return to service today, which will help ease the supply constraints and reduce the stage of load shedding.” The Koeberg unit is expected to only be back in service over the weekend. “In the meantime, we continue using emergency generation reserves, including diesel, to supplement supply.”  Load shedding schedules Customers can find their various load shedding schedules on their local metro or municipal websites, where applicable, or from Eskom directly.
