South Africa has seen a jump in confirmed coronavirus cases in the country, with the total now at 554 – up 152 from Monday’s report, said health minister Zweli Mkhize. Speaking at a press briefing on Tuesday (24 March), Mkhize said that the majority of these cases are in a ‘good condition’ and most are not symptomatic. He added that two patients are currently being treated in the Intensive Care Unit at private hospitals, but he added that there have been no confirmed deaths. Mkhize said that the number of South African cases are expected to increase over the next week, with a change in cases hopefully being seen in the next two to three weeks as the effects of the lockdown are seen. “We must not be shocked when we the number (of cases) increase, but these measures – if we all work together – will turn the curve around. It won’t happen tomorrow, it won’t happen next week, and if there is any change it will will probably be seen in a couple of weeks,” said Mkhize. The health minister said that testing capacity will be ramped up, and said that if a confirmed case refuses to follow regulations their names will be made public.
