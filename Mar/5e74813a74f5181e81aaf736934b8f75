The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in South Africa has jumped to 150, president Cyril Ramaphosa said on Thursday (19 March). The president made the new number known in a briefing following a meeting with religious leaders. This new figure is up 30% from the previous overnight tally of 116 infected, with 34 new cases. “The level of infection has now risen to 150, and that for us is concerning, because that already tells us that if you extrapolate that, it could start to rise in greater number. “This reinforces our message about social distancing, that we should as much as possible reduce gatherings of people and not go beyond 100,” he said.

It’s a broad measure to slow down the spread of infections, which will help officials curb transmission. This leaves it open to interpretation for individuals to assess the risks associated with any activity they choose to do. The Department of Health has provided its own guidelines for what to avoid, or be cautious around where possible – but none of these recommendations are currently enforced. It’s up to individuals and communities to opt-in to the concepts to best serve their families and wider communities. By 14h00 on Thursday, the number of confirmed cases of coronavirus around the world totalled over 225,400, with 9,277 deaths. There are over 130,300 active cases, with 85,800 recoveries. As many as 166 countries, areas or territories have confirmed cases. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-382305 lazyloaded" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-distancing.jpg" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-distancing.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-distancing-300x278.jpg 300w" alt="" width="750" height="694" data-src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-distancing.jpg" data-aspectratio="750/694" data-srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-distancing.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Social-distancing-300x278.jpg 300w" /> Read: Massive border fence between South Africa and Zimbabwe to combat coronavirus spread
