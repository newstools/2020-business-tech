The South African Revenue Service (SARS) will continue to offer a number of services during South Africa’s 21-day coronavirus lockdown, says commissioner Edward Kieswetter. “We wish to reassure them that SARS remains committed to providing the necessary services necessary for government to continue receiving the necessary tax revenues that fund the provision of public goods and services, whilst ensuring that the much-needed refunds flow to taxpayers already experiencing hardship,” he said. “Even during this trying time, as part of our strategic objective, we will continue to provide certainty and make it easy for taxpayers and traders to interact with SARS. “I am sure that honest taxpayers would also like the assurance that during this time, our tax and customs laws remain in force to prevent fraudulent and criminal abuse of the tax system.
