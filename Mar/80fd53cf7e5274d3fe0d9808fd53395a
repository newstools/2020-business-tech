Integrated facilities management company, Servest, has partnered with mobile payments platform Zapper to launch a virtual pay station for parking in South Africa. The system is cashless and provides a fully automated alternative for the processing of parking ticket payments. It presents an alternative pay point and addresses the day-to-day pain points around convenience and time management as it eliminates unnecessary queuing time to pay for parking tickets, Servest said. Using Zapper’s mobile payment technology, the system prints a unique Zapper QR code on the parking ticket, which is scanned by a customer using the Zapper app to make a payment before exiting the facility. The solution also unlocks valuable consumer insights, enabling loyalty and engagement opportunities for the Landlord, Servest said. “The parking and transportation industries have evolved at pace over the last few years, and so have consumer demands. In our research, we found that consumers no longer accept conventional entry and payment methods to parking. They want convenient, agile and easy to use integrated solutions that are aligned to their lifestyle needs,” said Richard Mynhardt, MD, parking solutions at Servest. According to Servest, the new payment system will be rolled out across Servest operated facilities within South Africa, with the initial focus on Designa operated parking systems. “Considering some of the research and trends that have emerged through innovative parking solutions for cities around the world, we realised that our parking systems no longer speak to customer needs. This partnership aims to deliver much needed innovative solutions for the South African market to enhance every customer’s user experience.” Read: It will cost you R250,000 to buy a parking spot at Cape Town’s new tallest building
