FNB customers can now earn and spend eBucks when ordering from the Mr D Food app with their qualifying FNB/RMB Private Bank Accounts. Mr D Food delivers meals from over 5,000 restaurants to over a million customers around South Africa via the mobile app. eBucks earn and spend is only available on the Mr D Food App, the bank said. Customers will order from their favourite restaurants on the Mr D Food App, using their pre-loaded qualifying FNB/RMB Private Bank cards to pay. Once the order has been placed, they need to opt in to earn eBucks by choosing the ‘Earn eBucks’ option and enter their SA ID number. The restaurants will then prepare the order, and a nearby delivery person will deliver it to the customer. “We are very excited about this partnership with FNB and eBucks Rewards. A large number of our app users are FNB banked customers and we’ve seen these numbers grow exponentially by over 400% in the past 24 months. “This collaboration means customers will now be rewarded for their orders or they can use their eBucks to buy meals from our assorted partner restaurants across South Africa,” said Devin Sinclair, chief executive officer of Mr D Food. Mr D Food joins more than 40 eBucks Rewards partners across various retail and online categories. “At eBucks Rewards we are constantly trying to find ways for our members to stretch their wallets in a manner that is relevant and achievable. Members can look forward to another exciting new partnership that will be launched in April 2020,” said Johan Moolman, eBucks Rewards chief executive. eBucks Rewards made it into the top five most-used loyalty programmes in South Africa at the latest findings of the 2019/20 Truth and BrandMapp Loyalty Landscape Whitepaper.
