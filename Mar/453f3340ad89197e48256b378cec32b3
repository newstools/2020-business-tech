Eskom says it will institute stage 1 load shedding from 09h00 – 23h00 on Monday (9 March) following a number of unplanned breakdowns. The power utility said that the power cuts will likely continue until Thursday (12 March) as its units come back online. “Implementing load shedding will put Eskom in a better position to meet the rising demand during the week. Work is also continuing to return to service some of the unplanned breakdowns we experienced. “The system is currently constrained, unpredictable and vulnerable. Demand has also incrementally risen since January, putting pressure on the ageing fleet,” it said.
