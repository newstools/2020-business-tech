The Gauteng Provincial Government has published a new report outlining its development plans for the province over the next decade. The documents shows that the construction will be implemented along five development corridors that have distinct industries and different comparative advantages. These corridors are: The Central Development Corridor – anchored on the city of Johannesburg as the hub of finance, services, information and communication technology, and pharmaceutical industries;
The Eastern Development Corridor – built around the economy of the Ekurhuleni metro as the hub of manufacturing, logistics and transport industries;
The Northern Development Corridor – anchored on Tshwane as the administrative capital city and the hub of the automotive sector, research, development, innovation and the knowledge-based economy;
The Western Corridor – encompassing the economy of the West Rand district and the creation of new industries, new economic nodes and new cities; and
The Southern Corridor – encompassing the economy of the Sedibeng district and the creation of new industries, new economic nodes and new cities. <img class="size-full wp-image-309146 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects.png" alt="" width="1284" height="717" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects.png 1284w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-300x168.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-768x429.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-1024x572.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/Gauteng-mega-projects-1200x670.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “In the centre and in all four corners of the province, the development of economic corridors was underway,” the authors state. “This monumental strategy had forever altered sole reliance on a skewed capital-intensive productive base, dominated as it had been by large enterprises principally operating in only three of Gauteng’s metro areas. “Regional economic inclusiveness was now showing signs of breaking past the dismal employment status quo and opening up the possibility of keeping up with future demands for jobs.” Below BusinessTech looked at the different projects planned for the five development corridors and how they are expected to change the province.
