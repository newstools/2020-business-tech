Toyota has launched a more upmarket 12-generation Corolla model in South Africa, offering a range of new specifications and features. “Like its hatched sibling, this new-generation sedan is built on the latest TNGA platform. It is a marked step up from its predecessor with a powerful and efficient new drivetrain, a sharper design language, crisp handling and superb ride comfort, as well as a long list of driver-assistance safety niceties never before seen on Corolla,” said Glenn Crompton, Toyota VP of marketing. Toyota said that its new Corolla will be offered in two grades. The top-of-the-range XR includes a new TNGA 2.0-litre petrol engine which comes with a choice of a six-speed manual gearbox or 10-speed continuously variable transmission (CVT). The mid-range XS is equipped with a 104 kW 1.8-litre powertrain, exclusively mated to the CVT transmission. The manufacturer said that its new 2.0-litre petrol engine delivers a substantial 22 kW and 27 Nm increase in power and torque compared with its predecessor, with maximum outputs of 125 kW and 200 Nm. Improved efficiency and advanced technology will offer a lower fuel consumption than the previous petrol engine, returning combined cycle figures of 6.0l/100km for the CVT versions and 6.5l/100km for the manual variant, the group said. <img class="size-full wp-image-380345 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-1.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-1.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-1-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-1-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-380347 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-380349 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="748" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-3-300x224.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Toyota-3-768x574.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380393" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla7.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla7.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla7-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380391" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla6.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla6.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla6-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380381" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla2.jpg" alt="" width="794" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla2.jpg 794w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla2-300x189.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla2-768x484.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380387" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla4.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla4.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla4-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380389" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla5.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla5.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla5-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-380385" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla3.jpg" alt="" width="749" height="500" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla3.jpg 749w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Corolla3-300x200.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Toyota said it has also substantially improved comfort, convenience and safety features across the board.
