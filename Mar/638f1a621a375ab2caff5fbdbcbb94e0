Eskom says that some of its staff and workers are exempt from South Africa’s strict lockdown restrictions and should be able to keep power supply over the three week period. Because of this, the power utlity said that it does not foresee any impediments to the generation and supply during the lockdown period, and no load shedding is expected. “Our suppliers, particularly the coal mines, logistics, suppliers and those supplying the parts and maintenance services at our power stations, will be able to operate through the lockdown,” it said. However, despite this, it said that the possibility of load shedding will persist.  Speaking at a cabinet media briefing on Wednesday, Mineral Resources and Energy minister Gwede Mantashe said that Eskom would be under less strain during the lockdown period as most business and high-use industries will be quietening down. “Supplying Eskom with coal is a requirement and we are appreciative of the fact that with a lockdown the demand will be very low, therefore it is unlikely that we will have load-shedding. “Therefore we don’t have a fear of load-shedding, but we require Eskom not to be in a situation where they cannot supply electricity to society,” he said. Eskom asked all stakeholders in the country to work with the group to manage electricity consumption responsibly.
