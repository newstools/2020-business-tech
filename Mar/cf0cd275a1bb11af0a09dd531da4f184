Online cleaning service SweepSouth has launched a new service aimed at assisting people with jobs outside of the home. Currently available through the SweepSouth website – with the app soon to be updated – SweepSouth clients in Johannesburg and Cape Town can now book a ‘SweepStar’ to assist with outdoor necessities whether it be gardening or pool cleaning. SweepSouth said that clients can also hire people to help clean windows or assist with carrying boxes when moving, with the service set to launch in Durban and Pretoria in the next few weeks. “As with the traditional SweepSouth service, SweepSouth Outdoor will be providing clients with trusted, reliable, vetted outdoor cleaners, to assist with the current offering of gardening, exterior window cleaning, outdoor cleaning, and moving help,” the company said. “Similar to how SweepSouth functions, SweepSouth Outdoor can be ordered as an on-demand or regular service. Users will simply choose the number of hours as well as tasks needed to be completed.” Launched in 2014, SweepSouth said it has created work opportunities for more than 20,000 previously unemployed and underemployed domestic workers, and will look to do the same with its Outdoor service.
