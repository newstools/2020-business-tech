The latest edition of the QS World University Rankings by Subject has been released, featuring 12 South African universities with courses that are among the top 600 in the world.

The 12 universities ranked in the 2020 subject listing marks the most South African institutions ever ranked, and includes the debut of the International Hotel School of South Africa. South African universities ranked in 38 of the 48 subjects covered in the QS listing, with a particularly strong showing in Chemical Engineering, Medicine and Chemistry. The best performances were seen in Development Studies, Mining and Mineral Engineering, Veterinary Sciences and in Hospitality, where the International Hotel School made its debut, ranking 44th.
