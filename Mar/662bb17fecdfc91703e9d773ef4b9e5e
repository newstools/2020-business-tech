South Africa’s biggest retail banks say that only around 15-20% of their lending books do not definitely qualify for coronavirus relief measures announced. Speaking to Reuters, representatives from the banks said that customers who would not qualify were those whose loans were already impaired prior to the outbreak. Others who had fallen behind on payments, for instance, may be able to access support, but this was not guaranteed. Here’s what the banks said: FNB chief executive officer Jacques Celliers said around 70-80% of its lending book would definitely qualify under the current relief measures;
Nedbank said around 80% of its book would definitely qualify;
Standard Bank said that only around 5% of its book – those in the most serious impairment category – would definitely not qualify,
Absa said 85% would qualify with no exceptions, while 8% did not qualify whatsoever. The different relief options being offered by these banks are outlined below.

Customers in good standing (with up-to-date accounts), and who have been financially impacted by the pandemic will have the opportunity to opt-in for payment relief, aimed at assisting with cash flow needs. “We realise that this is a difficult time for our customers and businesses whose financial means are being negatively affected. After careful consideration and engagements with regulators, we are pleased to introduce a comprehensive customer, business and corporate relief programme,” said Daniel Mminele, Group chief executive of Absa. He said that the programme, effective on Monday, 30 March 2020, is in line with the principles of an industry agreed approach. “We urge those of our customers who are able to continue making their payments, to do so.  This will enable us to extend these measures to many more who are not in a similar position,” Mminele said. Eligible customers in need of short-term liquidity relief will qualify for the relief programme that applies to Absa’s credit products. These relief measures apply to Absa’s corporate, wealth, business bank, private bank and retail customers. Crucially, this programme will not attract additional administration fees for customers. Support to corporate and business banking clients will entail solutions based on their unique requirements and operations. Businesses and corporates are encouraged to contact their relationship managers for further details, the bank said. The programme incorporates a three-month payment relief and allows customers in need of short-term financial relief to reduce their monthly instalments.
