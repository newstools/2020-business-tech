Gauteng is the hardest hit by the coronavirus outbreak and currently has 109 confirmed infections, with 33 of these infections reported in the last day. “A lockdown may just be where we are all headed and the decision to do so has to be made by our national leadership,” said Makhura. “We will raise it with the president. We are watching these numbers very closely and we are worried,” said Makhura. He expressed absolute confidence in president Cyril Ramaphosa and the leadership team to do the right thing.
