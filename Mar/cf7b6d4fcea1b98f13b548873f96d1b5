Telkom says that it will close stores in compliance with a national lockdown for the next 21 days, from 23:59pm on Thursday, 26 March until 16 April 2020. “As a company, we wholeheartedly support this measure. There is no doubt that this is the best tool we have to flatten the curve and save lives. We salute the strong action taken by the government,” said Serame Taukobong, CEO Telkom Consumer. In response, all Telkom stores will be closed for the duration of the lockdown as regulated by government. “However, our customers are able to get their services such as airtime top up or data and LTE bundles through the Telkom website or app and the retail outlets that will remain open. MiFi routers that enable connectivity for multiple people and devices can be purchased at retail stores,” said Taukobong. “We understand that our customers will be relying on their connectivity during this time therefore Telkom has put a range of plans in place to ensure network availability and stability.” Telkom said that call centres will remain open however with fewer agents primarily working from home. “These are extra ordinary times, we therefore request customers to be patient during this period and we will prioritise any critical failures,” Taukobong said. “We remain steadfast in ensuring that our connectivity services remain up throughout and as such all essential and necessary services will be running, managed and where needed, improvements made to them.” Telkom said it continues to work closely with its partners and suppliers to ensure all critical equipment, to keep the network stable, is in stock and available for use. “Our technicians will be available to attend to critical work on the network and to support our customers as needed,” said Taukobong.
