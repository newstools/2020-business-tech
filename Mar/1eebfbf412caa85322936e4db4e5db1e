Absa said Wednesday (11 March), that it recorded a ‘resilient performance’ for the year ended December 2019, considering the challenging macroeconomic backdrop. However it saw a decline in its retail and corporate banking segments, as consumers and businesses alike felt the effects of the country’s stagnating economy, and credit impairments increased. The group pointed out that South Africa’s GDP growth has consistently disappointed over the past five years. South Africa’s economy contracted in the third and fourth quarters by 0.8% and 1.4%, respectively – leading to the second recession in as many years. The economy has been hit by short-term shocks, persistently weak business sentiment and periods of load shedding, it said, with GDP growth for full-year 2019 slowing to 0.2%, the weakest outcome since the 2009 recession. Despite stagnant growth and challenging labour market conditions, household credit extension picked up gradually through the year, reaching 6.1% YoY in December, the bank said. Headline inflation surprised on the downside in 2019 and reached a nine-year low of 3.6% YoY in November, reflecting weak demand and persistent slack in the economy, but picked up to 4.0% in December. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) reduced the repo rate by 25 bps in July 2019, citing the improved inflation outlook. “The rand spent much of 2019 trading weaker, but recovered towards the end of the year to finish slightly higher as a favourable turn in global risk appetite helped offset a generally downbeat assessment of South Africa’s risks,” the lender said. Absa said that it maintained balance sheet momentum, with underlying costs remaining well contained. Group headline earnings grew 3% to R14.5 billion, and diluted headline earnings per share (HEPS) rose 3% to 1 747.6 cents. The group’s RoE declined to 13.1% from 13.4% and its return on assets was 1.07% from 1.17%. Revenue, meanwhile, grew 5%, it said. A final ordinary dividend of 620 cents per ordinary share was declared.

Retail and corporate Despite the overall growth, Absa’s Retail & Business Banking (RBB) saw headline earnings decline 2% to R9.51 billion – primarily due to 38% higher credit impairments, the group said. Corporate and Investment Banking (CIB) South Africa’s earnings fell 6% to R3.23 billion, given 4% lower revenue. Total CIB headline earnings increased 3% to R5.95 billion, largely due to 48% lower credit impairments. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-380777" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-RBB-FY2019.png" alt="" width="950" height="484" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-RBB-FY2019.png 1216w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-RBB-FY2019-300x153.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-RBB-FY2019-1024x522.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-RBB-FY2019-768x392.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-RBB-FY2019-1200x612.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter wp-image-380775" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-EDB-FY2019.png" alt="" width="923" height="498" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-EDB-FY2019.png 1234w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-EDB-FY2019-300x162.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-EDB-FY2019-1024x553.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-EDB-FY2019-768x414.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Absa-EDB-FY2019-1200x648.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> In the retail banking segments, division performance was mixed, with headline earnings decreasing by 13% in Everyday Banking. This includes a massive 40% decline in the card business and a 25% drop in personal loans. However, transactional banking and deposit earnings grew 9%, the bank said. Without providing any figures, the bank reported growth in both retail and corporate customers. Prospects Looking ahead, Absa projects 0.9% real growth for South Africa in 2020. “We expect a continued difficult environment for the consumer, while heightened uncertainty will continue to dampen business confidence and investment. “Downside risks are significant and include the risk of protracted load shedding, a sharper global slowdown due to the coronavirus outbreak and the impact of a potential sovereign credit rating downgrade from Moody’s,” the bank said. The South African Reserve Bank decreased the repo rate by 25 bps in January and financial markets are currently pricing in a high probability of two further 25 bps rate cuts during 2020, Absa said.
