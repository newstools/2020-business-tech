As South Africa continues to battle the coronavirus pandemic, food delivery service Uber Eats has announced that it will offer free lunchtime delivery on weekdays. The meal delivery will also help support restaurants who may be seeing reduced sit-down guests where social interactions and gatherings have been discouraged, the company said in an emailed statement. “To receive your lunchtime order with free delivery, look out for the daily in app billboard with the updated promo code,” Uber Eats said. “Apply the code in your ‘promotions tab’ to enable free delivery on any order placed between 11h00 and 14h00 for that day. “The coming weeks will be challenging for all of us. We are committed to working with our restaurant partners, government agencies, first responders, and communities at large to keep people safe and fed, and will continue to iterate on our interventions to achieve this.” Uber Eats said it also committed to keeping the community safe and has introduced a number of safety measures, including: Contactless deliveries: To help you feel confident about safe delivery, you can leave a note to ask your courier to leave your food at your doorstep. We are working to provide couriers with sanitization materials. As always, your food items aren’t touched once they’ve been packed by the restaurant. Helping affected couriers: We continue to support Uber couriers and drivers with financial assistance in the event of a COVID-19 diagnosis or exposure, preventing them from working.
