Pick n Pay will open all its supermarkets and hypermarkets an hour earlier every Wednesday for elderly customers to shop for their groceries and essentials. The initiative will start on  Wednesday (18 March) and stores will be open exclusively for customers over the age of 65 years from 07h00 – 08h00. Customers should have a valid ID to enter the store during this time, Pick n Pay said. “A special shopping hour for pensioners was a great suggestion by our online community and we very quickly worked with our stores to make this a reality,” said John Bradshaw, retail executive: marketing at Pick n Pay. “All our actions are focused on supporting the well-being of our customers. We know that the Coronavirus is more of a threat to older people, and it is thus especially important that our older customers limit the number of times they are in busy spaces as much as possible. “This dedicated shopping hour for our elderly customers will give them exclusive use of the store.” Pick n Pay said that every Wednesday, all Smart Shoppers over the age of 60 will also earn double points in-store. Customers can claim this voucher at the Smart Shopper kiosk or mobile app provided they have updated their Smart Shopper profile with their date of birth, it said.
