Woolworths says that it has seen a big increase in the number of online orders going through its system since the coronavirus pandemic was declared a state of disaster in South Africa. The group said it will do everything it can to fulfil the orders – especially in light of certain products that are selling fast – but has also introduced new procedures to limit exposure in delivering orders. “As the Covid-19 (coronavirus) situation continues to develop, the safety of our customers, our employees and our delivery partners remains our primary concern,” Woolworths said. For all online orders, Woolworths is taking precautionary measures to reduce the risk of virus transmission. Here are some changes that are taking effect from 16 March 2020: No contact delivery When our drivers arrive at your delivery address, they have been instructed to ring the bell, and stand back at a safe distance.
As a precaution, during this time we will package your order in bags so that you don’t need to handle any delivery containers.
The drivers will place the bags at your door and wait for you to answer.
The driver will then record your name, with the date and time of delivery in front of you, so you won’t need to sign any paperwork.
You then collect your items and head back indoors; the driver will take any delivery containers and head off. “Please remember to wash your hands regularly, before and after receiving your delivery. Please avoid direct contact with drivers, such as handshakes,” it said. Stock and availability Woolworths said it has seen a large increase in orders during this period. “We are doing everything we can to restock items that are selling fast, adding quantity limits for certain items, and opening up more delivery slots where possible. “We are assessing the unfolding situation constantly, and we will continue to keep you updated of any impact to your online orders and delivery,” it said.
