Eskom will implement stage 4 load shedding from 14h00 on Tuesday (10 March) due to unplanned breakdowns. The power utility said that the additional power cuts were due to a trip at Koeberg Unit 1. “The unit has been disconnected from the grid due to a fault on the turbine side, however, the nuclear reactor remains safe.  The teams are investigating the root causes of the fault and will advise of the remedy as soon as it is established.” “The loss of  (the) approximately 930 MW unit puts further strain on the generation fleet, necessitating an increase in the stage of load shedding,” it siad.
