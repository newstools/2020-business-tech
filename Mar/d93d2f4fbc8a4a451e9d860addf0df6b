The Vitality Active Rewards maximum weekly goal has been dropped from 900 to 300 Vitality points;

Discounted Vitality Active Rewards vouchers for Netflix, BoxOffice, as well as gaming vouchers;

Vitality members with Vitality Active Rewards can donate their Discovery Miles towards curbing the spread of Covid-19. To help people achieve their goals, Vitality said it is also introducing an online fitness programme with a daily schedule of high-intensity workouts, yoga, surprise fitness challenges and more. These will be free to all South Africans and available at home through the Vitality section on Discovery’s website and social media channels from Monday, 30 March 2020, the group said. “Members can also enjoy discounts on home entertainment through Vitality Active Rewards with the ability to watch BoxOffice and Netflix movies for less with Discovery Miles.
