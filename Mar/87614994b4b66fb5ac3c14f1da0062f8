Eskom has announced that stage 1 load shedding will be extended overnight until 05h00 on Tuesday morning, with stage 2 load shedding set to kick in from 09h00. The group had earlier sent notice that stage 1 load shedding would start at 09h00 until 23h00 every day until Thursday. Load shedding will now likely continue for the rest of the week, it said. “There has been further delays in some generation units that were expected to return to service today. They will now only return during the court of the week,” Eskom said. “This has put additional pressure on the system and necessitated an increase in the stage of load shedding.”  Load shedding schedules Customers can find their various load shedding schedules on their local metro or municipal websites, where applicable, or from Eskom directly.
