Suzuki has launched its new S-Presso SUV which aims to offer a number of high-end features in a budget car price range. The S-Presso shares its engine with the Suzuki Celerio, a three-cylinder engine which offers 50kW at 5,500 r/min and 90Nm of torque at 3,500 r/min. Suzuki said that this engine also has an average fuel consumption of less than 5 litres per 100km which also makes it a strong budget option. All models in the new S-Presso range feature two airbags as standard and are fitted with an anti-lock braking system (ABS) with emergency brake-force distribution (EBD). Suzuki said that all S-Presso models also feature reverse parking sensors as standard, while the GL+ and S-Edition models will further complement this system with an in-built reverse camera. <img class="size-full wp-image-382895 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-5-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-382891 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-382933" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Suzuki.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Suzuki.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Suzuki-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Suzuki-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-382893 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="668" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/S-Presso-3-768x513.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> All versions of the S-Presso feature electric windows for the front occupants, rear parking sensors, air conditioning, power steering and a multi-information display, which includes information such as distance to empty, trip duration and distance travelled.
