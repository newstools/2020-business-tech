Loyalty consultancy Truth and BrandMapp have published their loyalty landscape whitepaper for 2019/2020, outlining the most popular loyalty programmes in South Africa right now. The report is based on the loyalty habits of around 26,100 adults, with a gross monthly household income of R10,000 or more. Respondents who indicate they use loyalty programmes were asked to select the loyalty programmes they use the most. As seen over the past five years, retail programmes still dominate the loyalty landscape with seven out of the top 10 being retail loyalty programmes. The Clicks ClubCard remains steady at number one, with 71% of respondents saying they use Clicks ClubCard the most. Pick n Pay Smart Shopper and Dis-Chem Benefit hold their positions at second and third place, respectively. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-381569" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loyalty.png" alt="" width="800" height="472" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loyalty.png 762w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loyalty-300x177.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> FNB eBucks entered the top five for the first time since 2015, and is the only retail bank to enter the top five. By comparison, Edcon’s thank U programme saw a 15% point decline from 47% in 2018 (at 4th position) to 32% in 2019, settling at sixth position. Woolworths WRewards also improved from ranking fifth in 2018 to 4th position in 2019, having also surpassed Edcon thank U. <img class="size-full wp-image-381571 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loyatly-2.png" alt="" width="674" height="428" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loyatly-2.png 674w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Loyatly-2-300x191.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Spur’s Family Card has remained as the only restaurant loyalty programme in the top 10 and has successfully achieved this over the last 5 years. Discovery Vitality also remains within the boundaries of the top 10 and is the only financial wellness programme featured in the top 25 most used programmes. When looking at the results by gender, “we typically see women skew in usage towards grocery and clothing loyalty programmes compared to men,” the report’s authors said. Men tend to use more programmes in the financial services sector and travel, they said. Read: 22 banking and accounting jobs that pay over R1 million in South Africa
