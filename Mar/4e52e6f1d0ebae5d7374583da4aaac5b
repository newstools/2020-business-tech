South African companies are looking for job candidates that are authentic, legitimate, fit in well and don’t throw up any red flags. Rudi Kruger, general manager of LexisNexis Data Services says suitable candidates are more likely to perform better versus those who have questionable backgrounds. “By investigating a candidate’s academic and employment history, employers can verify their past and look out for job-hopping patterns, relevant experience, qualifications, credit history and other business interests,” he said. By comparison, Kruger said that misleading information on a CV is one of a number of red flags that companies look out for. Other red flags include: Inflated job titles;
Inaccurate responsibilities;
False qualifications;
Criminal records;
Poor credit history. “Firstly, lying on a CV is a big red flag and secondly, the misrepresentation of their backgrounds could mean they are hired to do jobs that they are just not prepared or experienced enough for,” Kruger said. The financial implications of incoming and outgoing staff must also be considered, he said. Kruger added that should an employee turn out to be problematic, your business stands to lose more than just time, money and effort “Taking on an employee comes with recruitment costs, such as vacancy advertisements, administration and training and you would not want to have to repeat the process multiple times,” he said.
