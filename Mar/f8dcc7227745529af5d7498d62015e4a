Stats SA has published the latest GDP data for South Africa, showing that the country’s economy shrank in the fourth quarter of 2019. According to Stats SA, GDP growth for 4Q19 was recorded at -1.4%, leading South Africa into a technical recession over the period, following a decline of 0.6% in the third quarter. A technical recession is defined as two successive quarters of economic decline. This is the second such recession in two years, after experiencing the first one in 2018. A full recession requires other factors to be considered, over a longer period of time – specifically a decline in the agricultural, transport, manufacturing and trade sectors, as well as a drop in expenditure on real domestic product. The latest data from Stats SA ticks all these boxes, but these conditions typically have to persist over a greater period of time. South Africa’s economy declined by 3.2% in the first quarter of 2019 on the backdrop of renewed bouts of load shedding at the start of the year. The economic decline was reversed in the second quarter of the year, with quarter-on-quarter growth of 3.2% – but the country again saw GDP contract by 0.6% in the third quarter. This third quarter contraction has now also been revised lower to -0.8%. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378687" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GDP-Q4.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GDP-Q4.jpg 720w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/GDP-Q4-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Taking the latest data into account, year-on-year (4Q18 vs 4Q19) South Africa’s economic growth declined 0.5%, and growth for the year overall was a mere 0.2%. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-378689" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/South-Africa-growth.jpg" alt="" width="720" height="540" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/South-Africa-growth.jpg 720w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/South-Africa-growth-300x225.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The annual real GDP growth rate of 0.2% was primarily led by economic activity in finance, real estate and business services.

During his 2020 budget speech, finance minister Tito Mboweni brought estimates in line with international bodies like the International Monetary Fund and World Bank sub-1% at 0.9% for 2020. This runs counter to the 3.5% growth expected for sub-Saharan Africa in 2020 – the second-fastest growing region in the world.
