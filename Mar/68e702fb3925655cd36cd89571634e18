Despite expected economic downturn in South Africa due to the coronavirus pandemic, and muted hiring intentions as the country grapples with a technical recession, companies are still on the lookout for skilled workers. On Sunday (15 March) president Cyril Ramaphosa declared the ongoing coronavirus pandemic a state of disaster in South Africa, and ordered that a number of preventative interventions take place to minimise the spread of the virus among the population. Among these measures was a strong push for social distancing, which has had a massive impact on businesses in the country. While many businesses have taken measures to keep workplaces sanitised, others have encouraged employees to work from home, where possible. The National Treasury and the Department of Economic Development has encouraged businesses to function as normally as is possible in an extraordinary time, and has asked the population not to panic. Against this backdrop, businesses have been encouraged to keep economic activity up, and to remain focused on economic growth, job creation and productivity. According to the latest CareerJunction Index (CJI), job search and hiring activity increasing in February. The top employment sectors are in architecture & engineering, IT, manufacturing & assembly, business & management and marketing, the group noted in its latest report. The index reached 98 points in February 2020 (sub-100 indicated more job seekers than job offers). Demand for labour increased by 3% while job search activity increased by 5% resulting into slightly elevated competition in the job market.
