The Consumer Goods Council of South Africa (CGCSA) says it is working with retailers which have been permitted to operate during the shutdown period and has reiterated that there is no need for shoppers to stockpile. The list of stores which will remain open includes supermarkets, food stores, spaza shops and pharmacies. Specific operating times are yet to be determined through consultation with the government, the CGSA said in a statement on Thursday (26 March). The group also said that there will be no need for panic buying during the shutdown period as its retailer members have and continue to work with manufacturers to ensure continuous product availability. “Our retailer members will be limiting purchase quantities of certain in-demand consumer products to avoid unnecessary hoarding which creates artificial shortages and puts pressure on the supply chain. “They will also continue to observe the prescribed health protocols by providing sanitizers for in-store use as well as ensuring that customers maintain the acceptable social distancing as per Government guidelines.” The CGCSA said it has also been in contact with its members who will be allowed to operate to give them guidance on how to structure letters for their staff who will be required to work during the shutdown period, and which they will produce when asked by law enforcement authorities. Regulations published by the Department of Cooperative and Government Affairs on Wednesday state that all retail shops and shopping malls must be closed, except where these essential goods are sold. The regulations also state that stores will be prohibited from selling any other goods. Read: Here are all the goods which shops will be allowed to sell during South Africa’s coronavirus lockdown
