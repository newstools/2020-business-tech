Pick n Pay has launched a new online-scheduled grocery delivery service that enables customers to set up an automatic weekly or monthly delivery of items they buy regularly. Called Grocery Genius, Pick n Pay said that the service will allow customers an easy and more convenient way to re-stock products – from the week’s groceries to monthly pantry and household items. After a successful pilot with a group of shoppers last year, this service is now available to all Pick n Pay online shoppers, the retailer said. “It is as easy as ‘set it and forget it’ and the feedback has been very positive as time-saving has always been a major priority for our customers,” said Georgina Muirhead, Pick n Pay: Online manager Muirhead said that customers will fill an online trolley by selecting the products they want delivered regularly. The majority of these items will likely be found in their ‘personalised favourite aisle’ on their profile which shows the items they purchase most often, she said. Customers then select the day of the week or date of the month they’d like them delivered. “Customers only need to set up their scheduled delivery once and their basic shopping needs will be fulfilled weekly or monthly with no further action required,” she said.  <img class="size-full wp-image-378527 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay.jpg" alt="" width="672" height="277" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay.jpg 672w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Pick-n-Pay-300x124.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Muirhead said that Pick n Pay’s full online shop range is available for the scheduled delivery service, and customers will continue to earn Smart Shopper points for all their online shops. The Grocery Genius service is free and delivery for customer’s first scheduled delivery will be free. Thereafter customers will pay a standard delivery fee (R60). Customers can cancel or pause the service at any time – for instance if they go on holiday – at the click of a button on their mobile or desktop. “We also remind customers three days before their scheduled order is set for delivery should they wish to add or remove any products to their online trolley. “If customers forget to remove items they don’t need that week or month, they can simply return these items with the driver or in-store,” said Muirhead. “Our scheduled delivery shopping solution means those little annoyances like running out of milk or pet food late in the evening can be avoided. It also helps with stocking up on big or bulky items like toilet paper or heavy dog food. “This service takes away any hassle for customers as it is automatically delivered straight to their front door.” Read: Pick n Pay is trialing ‘package-free zones’ as it cuts down on plastic
