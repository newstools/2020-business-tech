Gauteng premier David Makhura has announced that the City of Tshwane will be placed under administration. Speaking in a presentation in the Gauteng legislature on Thursday (5 March), Makhura said that Gauteng executive committee met on Wednesday to assess the developments in Tshwane and decided to invoke section 139(1) (c) of the Constitution. This means the Tshwane Municipal Council is dissolved and an administrator will be appointed to run the municipality until a new council is elected within 90 days, he said. “The provincial government has a constitutional responsibility and obligation to the residents of Tshwane to create stability and ascertain continuity of service delivery,” said Makhura. “As I promised, we will intervene decisively in any municipality when service delivery grinds to a halt and residents are suffering. The provincial government is guided by the Constitution and law of the republic in terms of what needs to be done under the circumstances. “Gauteng is taking this drastic step in the best interest of the people of Tshwane, All necessary steps in terms of the Constitution will be followed to give effect to the intervention.”  Tshwane has been plagued by months of political fighting as the EFF, ANC and DA are all vying for control of the city. The issue came to a head in February after the resignation of mayor Stevens Mokgalapa which led to the automatic dissolution of the entire executive council. The new council election is now expected to dominate debate around the municipality as the parties continue to fight for control. Read: Mabuza calls for new by-laws to stop land grabs in South Africa
