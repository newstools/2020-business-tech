A global shift towards simplicity and minimalism in recent years has birthed the ‘tiny house trend’, which has taken off across the globe and has recently made its way to South Africa. Real estate agents Seeff explained that the trend is primarily focused on effectively designing the little space at your disposal for optimal use. “It encourages an eco-friendly lifestyle and offers the freedom to lock up and go. In South Africa, the tiny house movement has the potential to shift the economy, depending on how rapidly people cotton on.” “Another reason small living has taken off in South Africa is the luxury of going ‘off-grid’ which is a lot easier and cost-efficient with a tiny home than a regular-sized home.” <img class="size-full wp-image-379109 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-1.jpg" alt="" width="1323" height="751" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-1.jpg 1323w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-1-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-1-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-1-768x436.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-1-1200x681.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-379111 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-2.jpg" alt="" width="1323" height="751" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-2.jpg 1323w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-2-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-2-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-2-768x436.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-2-1200x681.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-379113 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-4.jpg" alt="" width="1323" height="751" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-4.jpg 1323w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-4-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-4-1024x581.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-4-768x436.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Wanderlust-4-1200x681.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Seef said that one of the best know tiny house designers in South Africa is Wanderlust Co. “The tiny houses that Wanderlust Co. produces will range between 15 square metres and 30 square metres,” it said. “They are often built onto a trailer, which makes these homes not only small but mobile. However, they can come in various forms.” Seeff said that the cost of a tiny home depends on its size and amenities. It said that the average price for a small home is likely to set you back around R270,000 to R850,000. “While this may seem expensive for such a small space; it’s a fraction of the cost of the average property in South Africa and provides mobility, enabling small homeowners to move to a different location as and when needed,” it said.

However, the trend is most frequently seen in Cape Town where space is at a premium. Apartments in the new 1 on Albert micro-apartment development range in size from 21m2 – 24m2  from R1,095,000 to R2,650.000 for 70m2. “1 On Albert will also feature communal recreational spaces, shops, a food court, laundromat, heated swimming pool and more – all part of a new conceptual design in living known as integrated living solutions which incorporates all the elements needed for inner-city living without actually having to leave the building,” said Byron Kruger, sales agent for Dogon Group properties. “Millennials are prepared to sacrifice space and purchase smaller meterage units if the location is right. They want to be close to the city centre, close enough to walk, bike, or rely on public transportation,” said Kruger.
