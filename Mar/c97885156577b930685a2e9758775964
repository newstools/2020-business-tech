JSE-listed chemicals group Omnia Holdings has informed stakeholders that it has been subject to a cyber attack on its IT infrastructure. Omnia supplies chemicals and specialised services and solutions for the agriculture, mining and chemical application industries. The company said it was alerted to abnormal activity on its network on 12 March 2020 and specialist teams promptly began investigating the incident. As a precautionary measure, access to the IT infrastructure was immediately restricted across the business and recovery procedures were implemented, it said. Seelan Gobalsamy, Omnia chief executive officer, said: “Our production facilities and operations remained unaffected by the cyber attack and we continue to serve our customers. Whilst the impact on the Group has been minimal to date, there might be some disruption from an administrative support perspective until the full functionality of the IT infrastructure has been restored.” Omnia said it takes the integrity of its IT network seriously. “IT security specialists have been working around the clock to restore all systems and address disruptions in the most efficient and effective manner,” it said. The group said it will keep all stakeholders updated on developments and progress. Read: Johannesburg says it’s back online after cyberattack and contractual dispute
