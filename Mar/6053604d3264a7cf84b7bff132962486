South Africa has seen a massive jump in confirmed coronavirus cases in the country, with the total now at 402 – up 128 from Sunday’s report. This represents a 46.7% increase in cases overnight, although there have been no confirmed deaths in the country. The Department of Health confirmed the numbers on Monday, following a delay in a planned presentation from president Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday evening. President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday met with business leaders to discuss the impact of the national state of disaster and engage on possible measures to mitigate the impact on the economy at large. Sunday’s engagement with business forms part of a series of meetings the President has held with various stakeholder constituencies – including communities of faith and the nation’s political leadership – in the week since his declaration on 15 March 2020 of the national state of disaster. Ramaphosa is now scheduled to address the nation on Monday evening. According to Health Minister Zweli Mkhize, the latest data is notable in that the Northern Cape has now reported its first cases – marking every province in the country with reported cases. “We will engage the public to give further details and explanations on the results, including the significant rise, the ongoing test processes, and each province’s progress on contact tracing efforts,” he said. As of Monday, 349,980 cases have been reported world-wide, with 15,306 deaths recorded. 100,345 have recovered, but 234,329 people are still infected – 11,218 of which are in critical or serious condition. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-384127" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="816" height="463" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-768x435.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-1536x870.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-2048x1161.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Coronavirus-23-March-2020-1200x680.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: South Africa’s high AIDS and tuberculosis numbers under the spotlight as coronavirus spreads
