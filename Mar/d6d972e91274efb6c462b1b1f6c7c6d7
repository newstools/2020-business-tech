Sasfin Group chief executive officer Michael Sassoon said that while many local SME’s were under pressure amid challenging economic conditions, Sasfin’s operating model had remained resilient during this period, primarily through its core lending to carefully selected, growth-orientated businesses. “We are particularly pleased with the improved credit performance, growth in our deposit book and growth in assets under management. In this regard, we have been able to support South African businesses and investors during difficult trading conditions and at the same time, remain relevant in a highly competitive lending environment.” Pillar Performances Banking Pillar revenue increased 2.88% year-on-year in tough economic conditions.
