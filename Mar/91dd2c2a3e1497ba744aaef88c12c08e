State power utility, Eskom says it will honour financial commitments and obligations during and after the lockdown as enforced by president Cyril Ramaphosa last week, to combat the spread of Covid-19 coronavirus. “Eskom recognises the gravity of the recent outbreak of Covid-19, and the difficulties the country will have to endure in our endeavours to arrest the spread of the pandemic. We would like to assure our lenders that as an essential and critical services company, Eskom’s operations will continue unimpeded by the national lockdown. “Accordingly please be assured that financial commitments and obligations during and after the lockdown will be honoured as they fall due. “In this tumultuous period, our partnerships matter more than ever and we are grateful for your continued support,” Eskom said. It said that together with its suppliers in the generation of electricity, chiefly coal miners, logistics companies and those involved in the supply of components and maintenance of power
stations, it has put the necessary measures in place to continue operating throughout the lockdown. “As such, Eskom does not foresee any disruptions to power supply as a result of the lockdown,” it said. Read: Treasury sees Moody’s junk rating as a cue to fix the economy
