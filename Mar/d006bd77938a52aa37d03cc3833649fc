As South Africa prepares to enter a 21-day lockdown, it’s important to note that essential services will be up and running – including those in place to protect your health and safety. Aside from emergency healthcare numbers specifically catering for the Covid-19 coronavirus, the government has also set up several other hotlines dedicated to other issues that may arise. These include for personal safety at home, and to report pricing abuse from retailers. Minister of police, Bheki Cele has warned that there is a possibility of an escalation in gender-based violence during this period, adding that the police’s Family Violence, Child Protection and Sexual Offences unit has been beefed up to assist. For normal crimes, the South African Police Service’s 10111 line will continue to be operational, with the South African National Defence Force supporting. You can also report contraventions of the lockdown regulations to this number. The Department of Trade and Industry, meanwhile, has ramped up investigations into stores that are hiking prices to take advantage of consumers who need essential goods. The contact numbers for these services are below. Government said that it expects a huge flood of calls over the next three weeks, and asks for patience as it tries to deal with all concerns during this time. Electricity supply, water and sanitation are considered essential services, so your local plumber and electrician should be able to see to any emergencies that happen during the lockdown, provided the normal restrictions (no contact and a safe distance) are adhered to, and they have listed themselves as part of the essential services. Other emergency numbers, for fire fighting and ambulances (10177) also still apply.
