Among the restrictions are the closing of ports and prohibition of gatherings of more than 100 people. The restrictions are being applied to hopefully reduce the spread of the virus, but government said it has a plan in place – reviewed constantly as things change on the ground – to deal with the disaster if and when it spreads to the population. Various government departments including the minsisters of health, higher education, basic education, defence, home affairs, and finance have come together to provide and update on what is being done during the disaster. Some important takeaways include: Quarantine is being made a priority, with municipalities looking for possible locations;
Emergency funding has been made available;
The school year will be reworked to minimise the impact on the curriculum;
Universities are not shutting down, but contact lectures are being suspended;
Stock and supply chains are being secured to prevent panic buying;
Taxis across the country will go through sanitisation processes;
Government travel has been suspended;
Extra officials from closed border posts will be sent to back up the ports of entry that remain open;
Port restrictions are only for people, not products, and will not block commercial operations;
The strongest measures allowed by the law are being put in place to prevent further disaster – citizens need to be aware that some of their rights will be infringed;
