Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula has removed the prescribed operating times for public transport and food delivery services in South Africa. Previously intra-provincial, metropolitan areas and districts public transport was permitted to operate from 05h00 to 20h00 with a grace period of an hour within which to complete the journey and drop off at 21h00. In addition, hot food delivery services were permitted to start from 09h00 and run until 19h00. However, the latest directive has removed these time frames – effectively extending the hours during which these services may operate. A Department of Transport spokesperson said that he could not comment on the latest changes  – as he had not seen them – but confirmed that this was an issue that the department was working on as commuters complained that they did not have enough time to return home. He also confirmed that the national curfew (20h00 – 05h00)  still applies and that this is not an issue that is regulated by the Department of Transport. You can read the new directive below.
