To help slow the spread of Covid-19 and similar viruses, a quick and easy solution is to regularly disinfect large surfaces using a cordless sprayer with a surface disinfectant. Used together, they are effective in sanitising work areas and homes in minutes. Click here to find out more from EcoDepot. This process will not clean dirty surfaces, but it will kill germs, fungi and viruses present on those surfaces. If done daily, this will dramatically decrease the risk of spreading infection. Virol-Oxy, an advanced surface disinfectant imported from Germany, is highly effective against bacteria, viruses (including coronavirus), fungi and spores. It is sold by EcoDepot as a safe, deactivated powder to prepare a 1% solution. It achieves inactivation of the Coronavirus strain at a 1:100 dilution rate. Virol-Oxy can even be used to wash off some food products, using a 0.5% solution. EcoDepot recommends using the Ryobi XSG-18 Cordless Spray Gun which is commonly sold as a paint spray gun, but is highly effective to spray disinfectant. The sprayer is easy to use and features 3 different spray options, one of them being a very fine mist spray, which is perfect for any surface that you wish to disinfect, without leaving untreated patches.  Stay safe, and together we can flatten the curve. Visit ecodepot.co.za for more DIY and home improvement products.  This article was published in partnership with EcoDepot.
