South African Airways’ administrators extended a deadline for workers to agree to severance packages after minister for Public Enterprises Pravin Gordhan said he needs time to explore funding options for the bankrupt state-owned carrier. The business-rescue team led by Les Matuson and Siviwe Dongwana are trying to persuade labour groups to sign off on retrenchment deals as a possible alternative to liquidation proceedings, which could see the near 5,000-strong workforce made unemployed without compensation. The plan is opposed by Gordhan, who wants to instead build a new airline. Unions now have until 8 May to agree to the offer to workers, according to a letter signed by the administrators and seen by Bloomberg News. If they refuse, all employees – whether represented or not – may be given a further three days to make up their own minds. The Department of Public Enterprises said Friday it wants to create a national carrier that’s both publicly and privately owned, profitable and able to serve South Africa’s trade connections.
