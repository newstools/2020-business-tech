Minister of Justice and Correctional Services Ronald Lamola says South Africans will still have restricted exercise times under the level 3 lockdown. Replying during a media briefing on Thursday (28 May 2020), Lamola said that the updated exercise times will now be between 06h00 – 18h00. He added that South Africans will be required to wear masks at all times and may not exercise in groups. Lamola has previously explained that the restriction on exercise and the evening curfew was introduced to help the South African Police Services (SAPS). This combined with the return to work of more than 8 million people, means far more movement that the police will need to monitor. “At this stage of level 3, the regulations places more responsibilities on individual themselves and make sure that their family members also comply with health protocols. “It is not the responsibility of the police only to make sure that we are compliant. The police only comes in when there is clear non-compliance with the public and the first intervention of the police is to urge you to comply. “If people are not complying then police will have tiot take action in terms of the Criminal procedure Act. But what we want to emphasise is that people take responsibility fo their own health, themselves and for all of us.” Under the level 4 lockdown regulations, South Africans are allowed to exercise between 06h00 – 09h00.  Movement is also limited to a 5km radius from home.
