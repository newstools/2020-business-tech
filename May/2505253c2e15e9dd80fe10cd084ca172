The Western Cape has reported the most coronavirus cases in South Africa with the province also accounting for more than half of the countryâ€™s deaths. As of Monday (11 May), there are now 10,652 confirmed cases of coronavirus in South Africa. This is an increase of 637 from the 10,015 cases reported on Sunday. Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said in a statement on Monday afternoon (3 May) that the total number of deaths has increased by 12, to 206. The minister said that 4,357 South African have recovered to date. The minister said that 356,067 tests have been conducted to date, up 14,731 from previously. Hotspots The Western Cape has reported a total of 5,813 confirmed cases. This is nearly twice as much as the Gauteng which has second-most provincial cases at 1,952. While this provincial disparity is concerning, the Western Cape government said that it has conducted substantially more tests than other provinces. Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has also indicated that the province has very stringent reporting standards and that deaths elsewhere in the country may not have been recorded as coronavirus-related. The Western Cape government said that the majority of its cases have been reported in Tygerberg (1,002 cases), followed by the Western Suburbs (739 cases) and Khayelitsha (736 cases). Most cases appear to be concentrated in and around the Cape Town area, with comparably few cases reported in other major municipalities.
