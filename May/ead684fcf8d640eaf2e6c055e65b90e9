The real estate industry will resume operations under level 3 lockdown on Monday, 1 June. The announcement has been met with widespread relief and excitement from industry professionals, as well as buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants who have been left in limbo since 27 March. “Real estate is such a huge contributor to the South African economy, and the source of countless jobs, both directly and indirectly,” said Tony Clarke, MD of the Rawson Property Group. He warned however, that the discussions with governing bodies are far from over. “Our goal is to have the industry formally reclassified as a Level 4 service to ensure vital continuity should hotspot flare-ups cause a return to stricter lockdowns,” he said. “We don’t want to end up in a situation where new leases or sales are paused halfway through the process because we went back to Level 4 lockdown and buyers, sellers and tenants were left to their own devices with no professional assistance,” he said. “This was a major issue with the original lockdown and we want to do everything we can to make sure we don’t end up there again.” Clarke is optimistic that the government will hear reason on this matter, saying they have been “very receptive” to input from industry experts so far. “Safety is obviously a major concern, and we’ve been engaged in a lot of discussion around ways to implement social distancing and stringent hygiene protocol during all real estate activities and transactions,” he said. According to Clarke, modern real estate is actually very well equipped to operate with minimal face-to-face engagement, making it one of the easier industries in which to prevent potential virus transmission. “We’ve been working around the clock as an industry to create the safest possible plan of action to allow people to put a roof over their heads without risking their health and safety,” he said. Lance Real Estate has some of South Africa’s most exclusive and luxurious properties on its books, including a 9 bedroom, 9 bathrooms mansion on  3,027 square metres, in Fresnaye. “This unique property designed by Marvin Farr architects, takes you on a visual journey from the minute you pass the guard house, as the gates open you are transported into a Balinese style jungle, complete with lush greenery and a water feature,” the realtor said. The property includes a two-bedroom staff cottage, which comes equipped with a bathroom and kitchenette. The house also has a gym / massage room – fitted with sauna and steam room, and an outside bar entertainment space. “Follow the pathway descending the property and one finds the tennis court, a piece de resistance as it is the only private tennis court in Fresnaye aside from the Fresnaye Tennis club,” Lance Real Estate said. The property has a guard house with toilet, garage parking for three vehicles and additional parking for four vehicles, the house has cctv fitted throughout and a sound system. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403131" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-07-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-07-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-07-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-07-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-07-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403123" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-03-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-03-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-03-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-03-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-03-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403121" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-02-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-02-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-02-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-02-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-02-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403129" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-06-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-06-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-06-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-06-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-06-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403133" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-08-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-08-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-08-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-08-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-08-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403127" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-05-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-05-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-05-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-05-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-05-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-403171" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-10-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="680" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-10-2020.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-10-2020-300x170.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-10-2020-1024x580.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Fresnaye-House-10-2020-768x435.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />  Read: Here’s how much you will save on a R1 million bond after the latest rate cut
