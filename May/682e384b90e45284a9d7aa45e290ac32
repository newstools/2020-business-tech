There is growing concern about the spread of Covid-19 in major cities such as Cape Town and Johannesburg as infections in the country continue to rise. Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize announced on Monday (18 May) that there are now 16,433 confirmed cases of coronavirus in South Africa. This is an increase of 918 cases from the 15,515 cases reported on Sunday when the country recorded its highest daily total of 1,160 new infections. The total number of deaths has now reached 286 – an increase of 22 deaths from 264 reported before. Hotspots The Western Cape has now reported a total of 10,035 confirmed cases – 61% of all cases reported in the country. This is over four times as much as Gauteng, which has the second-most provincial cases at 2,343. Most cases appear to be concentrated in and around the Cape Town area, with comparably few cases reported in other major municipalities. The Western Cape government said that the majority of its cases have been reported in Tygerberg (1,597 cases), followed by the Khayelitsha (1,345 cases) and Klipfontein (1,195 cases). The below graphic provides more detail on the areas which have been the hardest hit by the coronavirus in the province: <img class="size-full wp-image-399249 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Western-Cape-1.png" alt="" width="1195" height="673" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Western-Cape-1.png 1195w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Western-Cape-1-300x169.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Western-Cape-1-1024x577.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Western-Cape-1-768x433.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Gauteng The most number of cases in Gauteng have been reported in Johannesburg (1,204), but the region has also reported 1,019 recoveries.
