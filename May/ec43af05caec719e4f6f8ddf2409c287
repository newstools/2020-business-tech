The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs (Cogta) has published a new directive relating to the movement of people, goods and businesses during the level 4 lockdown. Notably, the directive appears to drop the previous deadline of 7 June for South Africans moving homes. It also specifically allows for the movement of individuals who are victims of domestic violence. For the first time, government has also outlined the process for the moving of businesses during the lockdown period. The new directive allows for the once-off movement of persons and transportation of goods where: A person who needs to travel to his or her new place of residence or business and to transport goods which are limited to household or office furniture and effects is permitted to do so during Alert level 4; (This person) must obtain a permit to travel across provincial, metropolitan or district boundaries from the head of court or a person designated by him or her, or the station commander of a police station or a person designated by him or her. This permit should indicate the people that intend to move; These persons should also be able to provide the requisite lease agreements or transfer documents or a domestic violence order or proof of change residence; Existing public transport regulations will still need to be followed.
