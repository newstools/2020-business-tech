Isuzu Motors South Africa (IMSA) has revamped its seven-seater Mu-X sport utility vehicle (SUV) with an array of enhancements for the exterior, along with more sophisticated, and upmarket finishes for the cabin. The safety package has also been upgraded with the addition of a Brake Override System (BOS), as recently introduced on the Isuzu D-Max range, which helps reduce stopping distances in an emergency, the group said. “The launch of the Mu-X in 2018 revived Isuzu’s proud legacy in the SUV segment and the updated model for 2020 brings fresh design updates and improved safety to this accomplished and versatile seven-seater,” said Dominic Rimmer, executive, technical services at Isuzu Motors South Africa (IMSA). Visually, the front of the refreshed Mu-X features a bolder radiator grille design, complemented by a restyled front bumper incorporating colour coding for the upper section and a contrasting gloss black finish for the lower portion, as well as for the fog lamp bezels, Isuzu said. Another of the stand-out features is the new 18-inch gloss black diamond-cut alloy wheels, in combination with a new gloss black finish for the side steps. The rear of the Mu-X includes a colour-coded upper section for the rear bumper, gloss back treatment for the lower trim, two-tone silver and black roof rails, as well as new tail light clusters with a combination of chrome and gloss black finishes. The cabin features piano black for the door switch bezels and trim panels, gear shift surround as well as the centre stack for the infotainment system and climate control. “Additionally, the switches located on the leather-trimmed steering wheel for the audio system, phone functions and cruise control are picked out in black with a silver garnish, while ambient lighting has been introduced in the door trims, adding a further dash of exclusivity and upmarket appeal,” Isuzu said. It also has a flexible folding centre and rear rows of seats, allowing up to seven passengers to be carried with ease. The electronic climate control system caters for both front and rear occupants – the latter having access to their own cooling vents. Leather trim is standard for the seats, with the driver’s seat offering six-way electric adjustment. A multi-function infotainment unit is standard on the Mu-X. It boasts an eight-inch colour touchscreen display that provides Bluetooth connectivity and audio streaming, as well as Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. Additional standard features include central locking, keyless entry and start, and touch sensor opening and push-button locking functions on the door handles. On the safety front, a new addition to the Mu-X is the Brake Override System, derived from the D-MAX. The system is linked to the ABS braking system, and restricts accelerator input if the brakes are applied at the same time – thereby reducing the vehicle’s stopping distance in an emergency. The Mu-X is powered by a 3.0-litre four-cylinder intercooled turbodiesel engine that produces 130kW of power and 380 Nm of torque. It is mated to a six-speed automatic transmission which includes a sequential sport mode. “A three-tonne towing capacity makes the Mu-X a great choice for pulling trailers and boats, in keeping with its adventurous, lifestyle-oriented customer profile,” Isuzu said.
