The novel coronavirus belongs to a group of viruses that begin in bats, and it’s still unclear what animal may have transmitted it to humans, Peter Ben Embarek, a WHO expert in animal diseases that jump to humans, said Friday in a briefing with reporters, as reported by Bloomberg. The virus probably arrived in humans through contact with animals while raising food, though it’s unclear which species, he said. Cats and ferrets are susceptible to the virus, and dogs to a lesser extent, and it’s important to find which animals can get it to avoid creating a “reservoir” in another species, he said. The first human cases were detected in and around Wuhan, and most people had contact with the animal market, though not all, Ben Embarek said. Questions about the origin of Sars-CoV2, the virus that has caused the pandemic, have burned hotter since US president Donald Trump suggested that it came from a lab in China. Scientists who have studied the issue maintain that the virus originated in an animal, and probably entered the human population in November, Bloomberg reported. Moving house Citizens and businesses wishing to move premises during the Covid-19 lockdown can now do so in South Africa. This comes after Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) minister, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, issued and gazetted a set of amendments of the directions to address, prevent and combat the spread of Covid-19 in South Africa. The directives are known as the “Directions on the once-off movement of persons and the transportation of goods for purposes of relocation”. The once off movement of premises commenced on Thursday, 7 May, and will conclude on 7 June 2020. The directions allow individuals and business to move premises within, and across provincial, metropolitan or district boundaries during the period of Alert level 4. The COGTA Ministry in a statement said citizens who were not able to move house previously during the lockdown, will now be allowed to move houses with goods. “This includes new lease agreements which were entered into before or during the lockdown period; or in instances where the property transfer occurred before the lockdown period. These directions are limited to a change in place of residence, including the transport of goods to a new place of residence, within the Republic,” it said. The ministry said anyone who wishes to take advantage of this period to move, with their goods within, or across provincial, metropolitan or district boundaries, must obtain a permit from the station commander of a police station or a person designated by him or her. All removals must be performed in compliance with Covid-19 regulations and the relevant directions issued by the Minister of Transport.
