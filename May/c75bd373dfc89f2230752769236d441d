Fourth quarter sales declined by 18% at actual exchange rates, with sales in Asia Pacific down by 36%, including Hong Kong SAR, China, down by 67%; sales in Europe decreased by 9% while
they rose by 9% in the Americas. Overall group sales for the year increased by 2% at actual exchange rates to €14.24 billion and were stable at constant exchange rates, it said, but operating profit for the year decreased by 22% to €1.52 billion. Profit for the year decreased to €931 million. The group said that growth was driven by Online Distributors and Jewellery Maisons, and there were good performances in the Americas, Europe and Japan – which offset a decline in Asia Pacific. “There are signs of improvement in terms of our business,” Rupert said. “Since our 462 boutiques in China have re-opened after the virus, we have seen strong demand. Equally, the steps we have taken in recent years to change the way we operate see the Maisons well positioned. “Our approach has been to shift from a fixed cost basis of operating to a more flexible model. We see online marketing as a key element of that.” However, despite this recovery, Rupert said that uncertainty around the virus will persist. “No-one can say when we will see economic activity normalise. Other economies will probably find it difficult to emulate China. We may be looking at 12, 24 or 36 months of grave economic consequences,” he said. “Perhaps that is too pessimistic but who knows?” Ruper, through the Rupert family and Remgro Limited pledged R1 billion towards a fund it set up – the Sukuma Relief Programme – to provide financial aid to formal SMEs affected by the Covid-19 pandemic in South Africa.
