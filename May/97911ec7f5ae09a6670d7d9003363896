BusinessTech has shown exceptional growth this year and has increased its daily readership to over 1 million unique browsers. This has cemented BusinessTech’s position as South Africa’s largest business publication, with a monthly readership of over 6 million unique browsers. What makes BusinessTech stand out is the quality of its readers: C-level executives, business owners, and qualified professionals. BusinessTech editor Gareth Vorster said the Covid-19 pandemic has created a great deal of uncertainty for South African executives and business owners. They are now looking for trusted information to inform their business decisions, which is exactly what BusinessTech is providing to the market. “BusinessTech leads in the provision of data-driven journalism, with accurate and up-to-the-minute news coverage of the pandemic, and its impact on the economy and people’s livelihoods,” said Vorster. “We will continue to ensure that our readers remain up to date with the latest business content as the country navigates its way through a recovery period.” Every month 100,000 CEOs, 715,000 registered business owners, and 1.8 million business managers read BusinessTech. This sought-after audience has attracted many new advertisers who are now using the platform to speak directly to business decision makers. BusinessTech has shown exceptional results for banks, financial institutions, and business-to-business ICT companies. This, BusinessTech’s Kevin Lancaster said, is because of the trust between BusinessTech and its readers. He said instead of pushing unwanted adverts to their readers, BusinessTech helps companies to create the right message for their audience. The response rate to these messages is much higher, as readers value the information.  This article was published in partnership with BusinessTech.
