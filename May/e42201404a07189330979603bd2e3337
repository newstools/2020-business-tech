Western Cape Premier Alan Winde has outlined the province’s approach to the testing of the coronavirus and how it reports its cases. In a media briefing on Thursday (7 May), Winde said that he has been inundated with questions from both the public and the media as to why the Western Cape has more deaths than other provinces. However, he noted that the Western Cape does not necessarily have a higher mortality rate than other countries, and is not higher than other provinces. “It is essential that we accurately report and record every single death of a person who was infected with Covid-19. “This sounds obvious, but it is not that simple. As we will share below, most of the people who have passed away due to Covid-19 had serious comorbidities. This includes diabetes, hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.” Winde said that the coronavirus can cause severe pneumonia, amongst other ailments, which can become fatal, especially in older persons and these people with underlying health conditions. It is therefore entirely possible for a death to occur in a health system, and for the cause of the death to only be noted as one of these underlying health conditions, he said. “This is essential because this information, like the number of infections, provides us with data on the progression of the virus, and its transmission. And this data is essential to making sure our health system is prepared to respond at the peak of the crisis. “The Western Cape’s Department of Health both understands this and takes this very seriously. We believe that we are accurately recording Covid-19 positive deaths in the province because of our rigorous systems and institutional expertise.” Winde said that it is important that this happens across the country. “If it does not, data will become incomparable and the effectiveness of its analysis might be impacted,” he said. He provided the below statistics which show the breakdown of deaths to date in the Western Cape, based on co-morbidities and age: *Note that the table reflects that some patients had more than one comorbidity. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-395997" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Charts.jpg" alt="" width="947" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Charts.jpg 524w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Charts-300x136.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “Our analysis of Covid-19 related deaths in the Western Cape, done when we had 64 deaths on Tuesday (5 May), found that our death rate is at 1.8%,” Winde said. “At this stage, this is in line with international data on the progression of the virus in other countries. As it stands now, the death rate is not higher in the Western Cape than it is elsewhere in the world and is likely to be the same rate countrywide (accurate reporting of data assumed).” Winde said that other observations include: There is a clear pattern between comorbidities and death, as indicated above; The deaths correlate with patterns of cases. The growth in number of deaths is linked to growth in the number of cases in line with this rate; The WC age group is slightly younger than what has been seen internationally (significant number between 40 -60 years old). The province’s health teams are analysing this further, but it is likely explained by a younger population and the general spread of comorbidities such as obesity and metabolic syndrome. Winde noted that while the information indicates that vulnerable groups are most at risk, this does not mean that those who are younger, or those in good health, should not worry. Cases are accelerating Winde said that the province’s data shows that transmission of the virus between people in the Western Cape is accelerating. “Community transmission is well established, and more people are going to get infected by Covid-19 over the coming weeks as the virus spreads. Its nature, as we have seen globally, is to grow exponentially. “This is a new phase in the transmission of the virus, which the entire country will enter into at some point (and perhaps has entered into in some areas already), depending on their trajectory.” Winde said that the lockdown bought time to prepare health system for the pandemic and the peak that is still to come. “It also allowed us to ‘flatten the curve’. It will not stop the virus, and it will continue to spread,” he said. “Our focus must continue to be on preparing our health response so that we are ready for the peak, on protecting vulnerable groups of people, and on ensuring that we continue to test and confirm Covid-19 cases in our province based on epidemiological evidence. “Accurate reporting of data is also critical. We must be fully transparent and honest with the people of the Western Cape at all times, because information is power. “The more data we have, the better our health response can be. The more information our residents have, the better they can help us flatten the curve by changing their behaviour. We must work as one team,” Read: South Africa’s business confidence falls to 35-year low
