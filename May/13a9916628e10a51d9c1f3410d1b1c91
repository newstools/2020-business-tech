The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) has outlined the regulatory changes for South Africa’s lockdown level 3. Broadly, the regulations look to open up the South African economy by allowing more people to return to work, while also lowering the restrictions on personal movement. However, a key focus at level is still to restrict the spread of the coronavirus in the country, thus most social facilities and activities remain prohibited. Some of the main changes include: Alcohol can now be sold at specific times;
Restaurants can open their drive-thrus and for collections;
The national curfew has been lifted;
Exercise times have been extend to all daylight hours;
People can start attending churches, schools and learning institutions, with limits. Gatherings of people are still prohibited, however – meaning no leisure travel, no attending sport events, and no going out to sit at restaurants, cinemas, theatres, or even vising friends and family for social engagements.
