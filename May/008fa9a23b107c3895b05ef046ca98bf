Six locally transmitted cases, reported May 10 and 11, were found in people already under quarantine classed as being asymptomatic before testing positive, according to the local government. All six cases emerged from a single residential compound and were the first new infections found in the city since its lockdown was lifted on 8 April. SA companies applying for essential service certificates The Portfolio Committee on Trade and Industry today heard during the level 5 lockdown, approximately 270,000 companies applied for essential service certificates. This was part of briefings by the Companies and Intellectual Properties Commission (CIPC) and the National Credit Regulator (NCR) on its contribution to government’s Covid-19 response. The committee heard that the CIPC was contacted by Ministry a day after president Cyril Ramaphosa announced a lockdown to develop a system for essential service applications by companies. To date, as at submission of this presentation, approximately 440,000 companies have applied and received their essential service certificates for level 5 and level 4 lockdown. The committee further heard that the system does not accept any other form of business namely, a sole proprietor, trading trust, industry body and partnership. The CIPC’s legal mandate only extends to companies in terms of the law, as there is no way to cross reference information for the above-mentioned. The Department of Small Business Development, as well as municipalities, have been advised to handle other business types. At the same time, approximately 1,300 certificates have been revoked, and this situation continues as more information becomes available. Regarding reckless trading, the committee noted that in terms of the practice note issued on 24 March 2020, and for the duration of the Covid-19 national disaster, the CIPC will not invoke the reckless trading provisions, if the CIPC has reason to believe that the companies are temporarily insolvent due to the national disaster.
