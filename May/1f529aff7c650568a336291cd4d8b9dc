Teraco on Wednesday (6 May) announced  that it will build a new 30MW data centre facility in Cape Town – Teraco Cape Town 2 (CT2). This follows the company’s recent 60MW expansion announcement of its Johannesburg data centre campus in Isando and makes the Cape Town facility the second-largest on the continent. Jan Hnizdo, chief executive officer at Teraco, said that the growth of cloud in the region has resulted in increased demand from cloud providers, enterprises and sub-sea cable operators seeking to locate their data centre infrastructure at the intersection of the Internet. Construction on the site commenced in early March 2020 and will continue in line with local Covid-19 restrictions with a targeted completion date of Q3 2021. The completed facility will comprise of eight data halls encompassing 8,000sqm of usable floor space, doubling the existing data centre capacity in the Cape Town region. Teraco launched its first data centre facility located in Rondebosch Cape Town, CT1, eleven years ago. “This new investment in the Mother City is special for us. To date, CT1 has seen four expansions since launching; the historic building currently has sufficient capacity until the new site is brought to market,” said Hnizdo. Hnizdo said that with the recent announcements of direct interconnection availability to the major cloud onramps such as Microsoft Azure ExpressRoute and AWS Direct Connect, Teraco has seen a growing uptake driven by the enterprise market.
