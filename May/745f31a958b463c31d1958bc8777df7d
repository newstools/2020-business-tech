Data analytics company Lightstone and Tracker have launched the ShopSafe app which provides consumers with up-to-date information on vehicle attendance at shopping destinations they choose to go to. Lightstone said that the website application is mobile  friendly and uses geo-location to identify your closest shopping centres. It then provides a comprehensive analysis on the number of visits each hour of a seven day week, to help you to find the least busy time to shop. This data is updated weekly, to reflect changing dynamics and is aimed at minimising the Covid-19-related risks consumers are faced with when visiting high-density shopping centres, The app uses Tracker’s aggregated and anonymised data and includes around 1,300 shopping centres from across South Africa. “Not only are we as South Africans very cautious of the exposure risk related to a trip to the grocery store, but with foot count restrictions stores have put in place, we are unaware of the number of fellow shoppers we could encounter, and the amount of time we may need to spend in a queue waiting to enter the store,” said Linda Reid, head of Data at Lightstone. “The aim of lockdown is to minimise our exposure to other people, to ensure the risk of the virus spreading is as low as possible,” says Michael du Preez, head of Product and Marketing at Tracker. “ShopSafe will provide you with a view of when and where it’s safest to do your next shopping trip to reduce exposure to a crowded space.” <img class="size-full wp-image-402211 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shopping-centre.jpg" alt="" width="902" height="385" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shopping-centre.jpg 902w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shopping-centre-300x128.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Shopping-centre-768x328.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> How to use the app The app is available through its official website here.
