This past month has been a tough for all, says Bryan Biehler, managing director of Huizemark. Not only were we required to make drastic changes to our daily lives, but we have had to push through the worst-case scenario on the business front. As the property market continues to remain in a static position, agents will need to adapt to a new way of working, Biehler said. “Everything is going to change, and in ways we don’t even know yet.” “Although technology and digital transformation has been something Huizemark has kept as a priority during its growth, we’ve never lost sight of the value of the relationship we have – not only with our clients but with our Agents and Franchisees too,” said Biehler. He said that even during the lockdown period, franchisees and agents were still making up to 30 calls per day. “We have always focussed on providing a property solution, not simply selling a house.” Biehler believes that buyers will soon need to be financially ‘pre-qualified’. “In a negative economic environment, sellers are going to want to know what the financial position of potential buyers is if they’re going to agree to access due to the potential risks involved,” he said. Huizemark already saw this trend taking shape based on the stats the team pulled three weeks into lockdown. 52 virtual Showhouses have already taken place since lockdown, with 101 listings, 36 bond applications, 127 appointments with clients after Lock-down and 45 sales. Franchisees have been urged to expand their digital boundaries to make sure they’re influencing and engaging within their networks in not only a verbal way, but a digital way too. “Estate agents will need to up their game as far as their skillset is concerned and will need to be prudent with how they evaluate the properties they’re trying to sell,” Biehler said.
