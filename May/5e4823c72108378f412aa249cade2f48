10X Investments has published an e-book, free for download, to help you better understand your company retirement savings fund, and to help you get the most out of being a member. The e-book, entitled The South African guide to corporate retirement funds, gives you a basic outline of how your company scheme works, and how you can ‘max out the benefits of membership’. It succinctly explains the various types of funds, how membership works, and it also highlights the benefits of saving into an employer-sponsored retirement fund. The e-book answers important questions around things like the importance of compound interest, tax benefits, tax allowances, fee structures, life cover, your asset mix, and maximising your investment returns. It covers topics such as: What factors affect the value of your fund?
Does my employer have my retirement covered?
Will the fund provide for my loved ones if I die?
You are leaving your employer. What now?
What if I lose my job, or my ability to do it? 10X Investments answers these questions, and others, in a user-friendly format. It will also give you the basic knowledge and the tools you need to ask the right questions and make the right choices to give yourself the best possible chance of a dignified retirement. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-395286" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10X1.png" alt="" width="1027" height="387" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10X1.png 1027w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10X1-300x113.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10X1-1024x386.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/10X1-768x289.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Mica Townsend, business development manager at 10X Investments, said that this e-book is a valuable source of information for employers and employees alike.
