The Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (COGTA) has published new regulation that will allow South Africans to move houses under lockdown level 4 – but with tight restrictions. The regulations, gazetted late on Thursday night by minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, give South Africans looking to move houses or to a new place of residence until 7 July to do so. This only applies to people who: Entered new lease agreements before or during the lockdown period; or
Where the transfer of immovable property occurred before the lockdown period. To move houses, you must obtain a permit to travel across provincial, metropolitan or district boundaries from a police station commander – or a person designated by them. This permit must indicate all the people from the household who will be making the move, and you must have on-hand the relevant lease agreement showing the expiration of the term, or the transfer documents in the case of buying a new house. The regulations follow confusion among South Africans who had purchased property or had planned to move to a new house before the nationwide lockdown came into effect. There were particular concerns about negotiated sales falling through as a result of the restrictions on movement. Prior to this specific concession from government, property experts had advised home buyers to err on the side of staying where they are, rather than risking falling on the wrong side of the law by moving homes.
