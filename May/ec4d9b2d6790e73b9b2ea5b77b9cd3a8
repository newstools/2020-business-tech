Shoprite is offering aspiring data scientists the opportunity to apply for a bursary and enter the Shoprite Group’s Data Science Academy in January, 2021. Aspirant data scientists in their final year of study still have until the end of June to apply for a bursary for the 2020 academic year. Based in Cape Town, the academy offers a year-long programme in which apprentices have the opportunity to extract knowledge and insights from complex data sets involving sales, inventory, consumer spending and much more, the group said. “A key component of this programme is the mentoring each apprentice receives from an experienced data scientist. These mentors act as guides that help the apprentices navigate the real work problems they will encounter in the course of the programme,” Shoprite said. The group’s extensive bursary programme assists students with tuition, books and accommodation fees, and comes with a work-back agreement, which in this case translates to the apprenticeship at the Data Science Academy. To be considered for the bursary and entry into the Data Science Academy candidates must at the end of this year graduate with a degree or postgraduate qualification in one of these fields: Data Science;
Mathematics;
Statistics;
Operational Research;
Quantitative Management (or similar quantitative degree);
Computer Science;
Industrial Engineering. Read: This South African mega-retailer has its own private college – here’s how many students it has
