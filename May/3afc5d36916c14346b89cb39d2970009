Consultations will start with Nedlac, before moving to the provinces on Saturday, before moving on to other parties involved. The president said that those eager for the sale of alcohol and cigarettes to return, will have to wait until the consultation process is completed. [TimesLive] Hunger games: South Africa’s lockdown restrictions will be determined by district, says Health Minister Dr Zweli Mkhize. South Africa will assign levels of lockdown restrictions for each of the country’s roughly 50 districts, depending on the number of active coronavirus infections there, he said. Government will review the restrictions for each district every two weeks – though it is not yet clear what limitations, if any, there will be on movement between districts. [Reuters] SAA truce: The Department of Public Enterprises and SAA’s business rescue practitioners have signed a memorandum of understanding agreeing to work together in resolving the crisis at the failed airline. In terms of the agreement, the administrators said they would not engage in the unilateral sale of SAA’s assets – or negotiate such – without consultation with and approval from the department. The two parties have also agreed to work on a rescue plan. [Moneyweb] Township heat: Gauteng premier David Makhura says that the coroavirus is in the province’s townships, and is deeply concerned that they are swiftly becoming the new hotspots for outbreaks. While the virus outbreak is concentrated in suburbs, particularly Joburg’s wealthier norther suburbs, the pattern of infection is now shifting, he said, with more infections now being reported in the townships. He said this is particularly concerning because even small numbers in townships can blow up really quickly. [ENCA] Markets: South Africa’s rand weakened on Thursday as demand for emerging currencies continued to ebb due to growing concerns over the impact of the coronavirus on the global economy. The currency also lost strength after President Cyril Ramaphosa hinted on Wednesday evening that metropolitan areas might remain on an “alert level 4” lockdown. On Friday the rand was at R18.46 to the dollar, R22.55 to the pound and R19.95 to the euro. [XE]
