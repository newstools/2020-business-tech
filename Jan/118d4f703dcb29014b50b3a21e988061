OAG Aviation has published its punctuality report for 2020, highlighting the airlines with the best on-time records around the world. The report is based on 57.5 million flight records from 2019, creating a ranking of the best on-time performances (OTP) for the world’s largest airlines. The best airline in the world is Garuda Indonesia which managed to operate 19 of every 20 flights on-time across the whole of 2019. That is 95% of flights arriving within 15 minutes of the scheduled arrival time. For an airline which operates 35% of flights out of the congested Soekarno-Hatta International Airport at Jakarta this is some achievement. Copa Airlines was ranked second in the world in 2019, having raised its on-time performance to 92% across the year. <img class="size-full wp-image-364408 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OAG-1.png" alt="" width="1214" height="459" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OAG-1.png 1214w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OAG-1-300x113.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OAG-1-1024x387.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OAG-1-768x290.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/OAG-1-1200x454.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Best in South Africa Looking at a regional level, low-cost carrier Safair was named as the airline with best OTP score in Africa and the Middle-East.
