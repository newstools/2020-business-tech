Skynamo, a sales app and management platform provider out of Stellenbosch, has secured $30 million (R430 million) in series A funding from leading US software investor, Five Elms Capital. Skynamo said it will use the investment to accelerate adoption of its field sales mobile app and cloud-based management platform, while scaling up operations to improve service to its rapidly growing customer base in the US, UK and Southern Africa. The startup serves its customers from its Stellenbosch, Johannesburg, Durban and London offices and has chosen Atlanta as its US headquarters. The company said it increases sales rep productivity and effectiveness by digitising paper-based processes, automating administrative tasks, and enabling easy access to customer and product information in the field. GPS technology provides managers with a real-time view of sales activity and sales rep effectiveness in the field, so they can coach their reps remotely. Skynamo said it integrates with ERP and accounting software such as Sage, Acumatica, SAP, Xero and Quickbooks to provide field sales reps with the latest product and customer information and order history while on the road or onsite at a customer. Its integration capability streamlines the ordering process and improves order accuracy, order fulfilment and time to invoice for field sales teams on the road. “We’ve backed Skynamo because we are convinced it has the perfect combination of strong value proposition and a relentless culture of delighting both customers and employees to become the leader in field sales technology,” said Fred Coulson, managing partner of Five Elms.
