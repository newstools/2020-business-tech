The rand has had a roller coaster start to 2020, impacted by tensions between the US and Iran and the constant threat of Eskom load shedding. While a weaker rand is not good news for South African tourists looking to travel abroad, it may help boost tourism in the country as international travellers find that there dollars, euros and pounds stretch further. However, despite a weaker rand, there are still a number of countries where it is still relatively inexpensive for South Africans to travel in 2020. Because direct currency conversion does not always give a good indication of the general cost of living, we compared the cost of food, drinks and travel compared to what you would pay locally. This means that the prices below are not meant to demonstrate purchasing power parity and do not serve as an equal-weighted price comparison.
