Movies remain big business in South Africa, with 19 films grossing over $1 million locally in 2019 according to data from IMDb Pro’s Box Office Mojo. In addition, 90 films made over $100,000 at South African box offices. The highest-grossing movie of 2019 in South Africa was The Lion King, which is a remake of the classic 1995 animated movie and stars Seth Rogen, John Oliver, Beyonce, and South African John Kani. The Lion King grossed $8.24 million (R122 million) locally, while the only other film to exceed the $5-million mark was Avengers: Endgame, which made $7.17 million (R106.2 million).
