A job posting on a small Irish island has attracted hundreds of applicants from as far afield as South Africa and Alaska. The advertisement is for the long term management of accommodation facilities and a coffee shop on Blasket Island, off the west coast of Kerry. In a tweet, the advertisers said that the position would be perfect for a couple or two friends. It adds that the position is open from 1 April 2020 – October 2020, with accommodation and food provided. Applicants are expected to welcome visitors, manage cottages, and run a coffee shop.  Speaking in an interview with Ireland’s national broadcaster RTE, advertiser Alice Hayes said that there has been significant interest in the position. However, she cautioned that while the island is beautiful and idyllic, it is ‘off the grid’ meaning there is no electricity, or WiFi, and no hot showers. “It’s intense and tough but it’s a very unique position,” Alice Hayes said. “It’s back to basics – fires, candles, stoves, wildlife and nature.” “We use gas hobs in the cottages and the coffee shop. We have gas canisters out the back. We know when the water is boiled with whistling kettles on top of the hobs, and we can cook on the gas hobs as well.” “A little wind turbine that generates enough electricity to charge one device, so you are not completely cut off.” Hayes said that ideal applicants must have a good level of fitness, good people skills and be friendly, approachable and chatty.
