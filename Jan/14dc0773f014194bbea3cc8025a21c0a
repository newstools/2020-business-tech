The Department of Basic Education has published a new school performance report, outlining the best schools in every province across South Africa based on the 2019 matric results. The report details the number of candidates that wrote the exams, the number of candidates that achieved the National Senior Certificate (NSC), and the pass percentage in every school, over the last three years. It also provides a list of schools that obtained 100% and those that obtained below 40% over a period of five years respectively. The report shows that a total of 18 schools across the country achieved a pass rate of 0% – an increase from 12 schools in 2018. By comparison, a total of 623 schools achieved a pass rate of 100%. The department’s data showed that 104 schools have achieved this result for a period of five consecutive years. It noted that 787,717 pupils from 6,854 schools sat the exams.  Basic education minister, Angie Motshekga said that 186,058 matric students achieved a bachelor’s pass and 144,762 achieved a diploma pass. The Free State achieved the best pass rate of 88.4% – a 0.9% improvement from the previous year. Gauteng with 87.2%, was second, followed by the North West with 86.8%. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-365058" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Schools-1.png" alt="" width="1000" height="628" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Schools-1.png 688w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Schools-1-300x188.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> While a 100% pass rate is an impressive achievement, the schools that stand out are those that are able to achieve this standard over a five year period. The Department of Basic Education’s data shows that a total of 104 schools were able to achieve this feat from 2015 to 2019. 31 of these schools are in Gauteng, 27 in the Western Cape, and 18 in the Free State.
