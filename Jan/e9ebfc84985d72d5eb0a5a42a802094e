South Africa’s new parental leave laws have been signed into law by president Cyril Ramaphosa – taking effect from 1 January 2020. The new legislation means that all parents – including fathers, adopting parents, and surrogates –  are now entitled to 10 days paid parental leave when their children are born. However, this new legislation does not apply to mothers who give birth as they are already entitled to paid maternity leave in terms of the Basic Conditions of Employment Act (BCEA). Parents are entitled to take paid parental leave once a calendar year and they must apply for it from their employer. Through these amendments, UIF contributors will also have the right to claim for parental, and commissioning parental benefits in the event that an employer cannot pay the full salary of the worker. The UIF will pay those workers 66% of their salary up to the BCEA (Basic Conditions of Employment Act) earnings cap of R205,433.30 per annum,  said UIF Commissioner, Teboho Maruping.
