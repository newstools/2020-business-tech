The South African Post Office (SAPO) has published its updated list of fees for services across South Africa. The new fees will be implemented as of 1 April 2020 and will see an increase in the cost of sending of ordinary domestic and international mail, packages, as well as the purchasing of stamps. You can find a detailed breakdown of the 2020 rates below. Domestic parcel rates Any postal item larger than 250 x 353 mm and/or thicker than 30mm and/or weighing more than 1 kg will be considered a ‘parcel’ by SAPO. It will also charge R61.35 for the first kilogram for counter to counter deliveries, with an additional R8.25 charged for each additional kg or part of a kg. Insurance is an optional extra, and the sender has the option of insuring the ordinary parcel at a rate of 3% of the declared value up to a maximum of R5,000 with a minimum rate of R4.55 per parcel.
