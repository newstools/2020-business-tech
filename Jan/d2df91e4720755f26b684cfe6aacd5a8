Preparing in advance for death or permanent disablement of a loved one is an unpleasant thought, but can only be of benefit when something does happen, notes Christel Botha, fiduciary services manager at Alexander Forbes. Death is inevitable, so planning for it should be a priority, she says. Natural or unexpected, your death can place a massive administrative burden on your loved ones long after you have passed if you do not have your financial affairs in order, Botha said. Having a ‘ready to depart’ file with all the necessary documentation and information needed in the event of your passing will assist your family with access to your will, living will, passwords and title deeds for example – having all of these documents in a single file or folder allows for ease of reference and access during what is probably an extremely emotional and stressful time for them. In the event of an emergency or death the following documents are crucial to include in your personal ‘ready to depart’ file, which can be kept in a safe or filed with your lawyer for safe keeping while you are alive: “While extensive, this list is not entirely comprehensive as no two individuals are alike or have the same policies and as such it is important to start the conversation with a financial adviser or legal professional to make sure your personal “ready to depart” file is regularly updated before you pass away,” Botha said.
