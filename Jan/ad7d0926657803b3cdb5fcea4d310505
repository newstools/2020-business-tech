Applications for the 2021-2022 Fulbright Foreign Student Program are now open for South African students. The Fulbright Program is the US government’s flagship international educational exchange and offers scholarships to students interested in pursuing a master’s or doctoral degree at any accredited tertiary institution in the United States. It was established in 1946 to increase mutual understanding between the people of the United States and other countries. It currently operates in South Africa and more than 150 countries worldwide. The scholarships cover up to the full cost of tuition and living expenses in the US with applications closing on 31 March 2020. South Africans wishing to pursue a master’s degree must have completed a four-year B-Tech degree or a three-year bachelor’s degree with an honours degree. Prospective doctoral students must have successfully obtained a master’s degree. In 2019, 23 South African students and scholars received fully-funded Fulbright scholarships to complete postgraduate studies at American academic institutions and to conduct research in the US. These students are currently pursuing studies in fields ranging from engineering, law, public health, and psychology, to education, political science and environmental sciences at institutions including Georgetown University, University of Georgia, University of Rochester, University of Toledo, and the University of Pennsylvania.
