South African motoring enthusiasts can expect a bumper year for new car releases in 2020 whether it be a face-lift, a new variant, or all-new model. Car advertising website, Cars.co.za, has recently published a list of all the expected vehicles hitting our shores over the course of the next year, including best-sellers like the Toyota Corolla and crowd-pleaser – the Golf 8. All the major German marks are also expected to release of vehicles, with Audi leading the way, followed by BMW, and Mercedes Benz, with at least five new ‘models’ being promised. BusinessTech looks at some of the new cars expected in South Africa in 2020: Toyota Corolla From every angle, the new Corolla sedan looks lower and leaner, tauter and tighter, Toyota said of its best-selling vehicle in South Africa. “Powerful fender flares and generously curved fender top surfaces accent its sculpted, athletic core.” According to Cars.co.za, the Toyota Corolla Quest is expected in the first quarter, while the Toyota Corolla Sedan is expected in Q2. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363646" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla1-e1577968327516.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="813" /> Golf 8 The Golf 8 is expected in SA in Q4 and will see a major shift towards digital. “Its digital interior enables a new dimension of intuitive operation. Speeds of up to 210 km/h are possible with assisted driving,” VW said. The Golf 8 GTI will be the first derivative introduced in South Africa with other engines options following after, Cars.co.za said. It is expected to be exclusively sold with a DSG transmission in South Africa. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363648" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/VWGolf-8-e1577968358232.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> Audi e-tron The Audi e-tron, a battery-powered crossover is due to hit showrooms in Q4. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363656" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E-tron.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="799" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E-tron.jpeg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E-tron-300x200.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E-tron-1024x682.jpeg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/E-tron-768x511.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Porsche Taycan The Taycan is an all-electric car manufactured by German automobile manufacturer Porsche, expected to arrive in South Africa in the second half of 2020. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-363668" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/porsche-taycan-e1577970527658.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> Mini Cooper SE BMW recently announced the 2020 MINI Cooper SE, an all-electric version of its iconic vehicle, which is set to hit South African shores in Q2.
