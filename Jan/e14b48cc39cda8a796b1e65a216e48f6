South Africans had a difficult 2019 – dealing with one of the world’s most volatile currencies, high petrol prices, and a rising cost of living. The local currencies volatility was further exacerbated by the Trump vs China trade war, an emerging market sell-off, and Brexit. Despite these issues, the rand has started 2020 on the front foot, with sentiment towards emerging markets broadly boosted by US president Donald Trump’s announcement on the signing of a trade deal with China, and on higher commodity prices.
