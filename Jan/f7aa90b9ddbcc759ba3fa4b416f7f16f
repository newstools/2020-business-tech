MTN said in a statement on Thursday (2 January), that it realised R14 billion in asset sales in 2019. The operator announced its Asset Realisation Programme (ARP) in March 2019 which aims to simplify its portfolio, reduce debt and risk, improve returns and realise proceeds of at least R15 billion over three years. Following on the proceeds raised from the disposals of its stakes in Amadeus, Travelstart and the ATC loan of R2.1 billion earlier in the year MTN said it has now concluded two further transactions bringing the total proceeds from its ARP to R14 billion. Firstly, MTN has concluded an agreement to dispose of its 49% equity holdings in the Ghana and Uganda Tower Company investments to a subsidiary of American Tower Company for $523 million, approximately R7.3 billion. This transaction is expected to close in Q1 2020. MTN Nigeria has also completed the redemption of its preference shares with MTN Group receiving, in December 2019, an amount of $315 million (cR4,4 billion). Group president and CEO Rob Shuter, said: “Following the completion of these transactions, MTN will have realised proceeds of approximately R14 billion within the first 12 months of this program. Realising proceeds from simplifying the group remains a major strategic objective and we expect further progress in this program in 2020.” Read: MTN paid off terrorists, new US lawsuit claims
