The Department of Home Affairs is extending operating hours to 19h00 from 2 January to 10 January 2020 to meet the anticipated increase in demand for our services during the period before schools re-open. The extension of operating hours excludes the weekend, it said in a statement. “At the beginning of each year, the Department of Home Affairs experiences increases in demand for enabling documents such as the issuance of smart ID cards and passports; birth and death certificates and for amendments and rectifications.” The department added that it will ensure that everyone who is inside an office at the time of closing receives required services. “Office managers/supervisors are to apply their discretion to close the office 30 minutes prior to knock-off time, subject to the number of people being serviced. “This is to allow officials to conclude all the necessary work before 19h00. The Department encourages people intending to visit our offices to do so as early as they can on their preferred day.” “We hope the period of extended operating hours will enable people who have applied for smart ID cards but were unable to collect them because of time constraints to come and collect them.” The department added that it is deeply concerned by the amount of uncollected smart ID cards by people who have applied for them.
