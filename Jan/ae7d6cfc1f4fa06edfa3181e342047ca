South Africans will have extended load shedding on Thursday, following a further loss of capacity on Eskom’s grid overnight. The power utility announced that stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 08h00 on Thursday, and will continue overnight until 06h00 on Friday. This follows two nights in a row where load shedding was implemented in the early morning hours, but not during the day. According to Eskom, the reason for the extended load shedding hours is because it lost further generating units at it power stations, resulting in unplanned outages of 14,000MW of capacity. Further, its reserves are not enough to keep the lights on consistently throughout the day. “Owing to inadequate maintenance over a number of years, the system remains vulnerable to unplanned outages,” it said. “Our teams continue to work tirelessly to return units from planned and unplanned outages.” It said that the system remains severely constrained and unpredictable.
