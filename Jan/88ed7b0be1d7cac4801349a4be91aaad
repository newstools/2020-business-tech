As part of its business rescue process, South African Airways (SAA) will cancel and consolidate selected scheduled flights in an effort to ensure flight efficiency. In a statement on Thursday (30 January), the airline said that this will include selected scheduled flights where there is ‘low demand based on current forward bookings for the month of February’. “We are committed to accommodating all affected customers on alternative flights, operated by the airline and its Star Alliance partners.  Any inconvenience or delays are intended to be minimal,” said chief commercial officer Philip Saunders. SAA said that travel agents, alliance partners and relevant stakeholders have been notified of these operational changes. You can find a full list of the cancellations here.
