South African fintech company Oyi has launched a new prepaid medical aid card aimed at helping people deal with unexpected expenses. Oyi said that product works as a savings card for medical spend only and is supported by a secure payments technology. It added that the card eliminates the temptation of using the money for other purposes as it can only be used to pay for doctors, medical services such as x-rays and blood tests as well as to purchase medicines from any pharmacy. “The Oyi medical card enables affordable access to quality healthcare which allows the cardholder and their families to seek medical care with dignity,” said Tami Ngalo, CEO of Oyi said. “With a social purpose to build healthy communities and sustainable wellness, we make healthcare accessible for everyone.” Ngalo said that the Oyi medical card lets you put money aside monthly or as a lump sum and use it specifically to pay doctors and buy medicine. “This provides flexibility to prepare for unforeseen medical expenses while it also complements a typical medical aid. Oyi savings can also be used towards co-payments,” he said. He added that the card is aimed primarily at employers who have some staff who are not covered by medical aid, the card allows for private access to quality healthcare for all employees. <img class="size-full wp-image-368436 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card.png" alt="" width="1127" height="571" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card.png 1127w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card-300x152.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card-1024x519.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Card-768x389.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The group said that the card operates in a regulated industry and is registered with the National Credit Regulator where the Oyi Medical Card/FlexPay MasterCard is issued in association with Mercantile Bank.
