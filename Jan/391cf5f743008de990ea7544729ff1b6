A new year brings higher prices and some big changes to South Africa’s medical aid schemes. We’ve broken down what the five biggest schemes in the country have on offer for 2020 – and how much they’re charging. South Africa is home to 80 different medical aid schemes, with 4.02 million registered members, serving a total of 8.87 million beneficiaries. Among these schemes, 21 are open schemes (that anyone is free to join) and 59 restricted schemes (for companies, or specific sectors or industries). The largest scheme by some margin is Discovery Health, which has 1.335 million members (33.2% of the total) and 2.79 million beneficiaries (31.5% of the total). Among the open schemes, Discovery is followed by Bonitas, with 331,955 members and 713,190 beneficiaries, and Momentum Health, with 156,761 members and 298,071 beneficiaries. This is followed by BestMed (93,635 members and 197,088 beneficiaries) and MediHelp (92,884 members and 201,944 beneficiaries). Medical aid users would have noted price increases across all medical schemes in 2020 – though some schemes have raises prices more than others. Discovery’s medical plan increases ranged between 9% and 11%, while Bonitas saw an overall weighted increase of 9.9% among its schemes. Momentum’s weighted increase was 8.2%, and BestMed saw price increases of 8.9% among options. MediHelp’s price increases average at 11.9%. What’s the same By law, South African medical schemes are non-profit trusts, owned by their members. In this sense, they are all functionally the same – members’ contributions are pooled and used to pay relevant medical costs where necessary, while keeping a legislated surplus to prevent the scheme from collapsing. Some medical plans have a savings option, which creates a savings pool from a member’s monthly contributions which is for exclusive use by that member. Medical aid schemes are also required by law to cover a set list of chronic illnesses, known as the Prescribed Minimum Benefits (PMB). This is a set of defined benefits to ensure that all medical scheme members have access to certain minimum health services, regardless of the benefit option they have selected. Beyond this, medical aid schemes are free to differentiate themselves through their product offerings, usually targeting specific demographics. Things like annual limits, specialised benefits, family cover, day-to-day coverage and networked doctors and hospitals all vary across the different plans – both internally across a single group’s plans, and from company to company. This article not a comprehensive review of each individual plan offered by the medical aids, and if you’re looking to change schemes, upgrade or downgrade, you should read through the information provided by the respective groups to ensure your health needs are covered.
