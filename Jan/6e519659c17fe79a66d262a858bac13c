They added that this exercise and will result in the preservation of jobs wherever possible. “SAA is a key strategic asset which needs to be positioned to provide reliable connectivity to markets within South Africa, the African continent as well as servicing selected international routes. “Stakeholders of the airline should now have comfort that the rescue process is on a significantly sounder footing, and that passengers and travel agencies and airline partners may continue to book air travel on SAA with confidence.” Read: SAA to suck up another R8 billion for ‘restructuring’
