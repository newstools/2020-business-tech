Travel company Hoppa has published its annual report into the most expensive vs cheapest destinations in the world to help people plan their holidays for 2020. The study considers a number of factors including average hotel prices per night, taxi fares, and meals for two, along with the cost of unexpected medical costs and average currency exchange rates. This year, Grand Cayman (a British territory) has been ranked as the most expensive location in the world, with costs estimated to total £459.58 (R8,465) per day. By comparison, Antalya in Turkey has replaced Manila as the cheapest holiday destination in the world, where a single night will set you back just £63.79 (R1,175). Once again, Europe and America make up most of the top 10 priciest destinations in the world, with the likes of New York City, Zurich, and San Francisco retaining positions inside the top 10. Two Middle Eastern Countries have debuted in the top 10 – namely, Abu Dhabi and Dubai. London has also made the top 10 list this year at eighth place – up from thirteenth. Many of the cheapest locations in the world are outside of Europe, primarily in Africa and Latin America – however, there are some bargain European breaks to be had. Kiev, Ukraine is one of the best places in Europe to grab a cheap break. Antalya, Turkey and Tbilisi, Georgia also feature really strongly as nearby locations for a cheaper holiday. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-365198 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Most-expensive.png" alt="" width="940" height="1210" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Most-expensive.png 940w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Most-expensive-233x300.png 233w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Most-expensive-796x1024.png 796w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Most-expensive-768x989.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Looking locally, Hoppa’s data shows that Johannesburg is now more expensive than Cape Town. Joburg is ranked as the 60th most expensive holiday destination in the world in 2020 at an estimated cost of £134.37 per day (R2,475). By comparison, Cape Town was ranked at 81st on the list at an estimated cost of £110.12 (R2,028) a day.

London also made the top 10 list this year, with hotels averaging £181 (R3,334) per person per night. These prices were calculated by looking at several hotels of each star category in each destination and finding the averages amongst those. Antalya and Tbilisi again jump out as great choices for quick, cheap breaks.

Cocktails, beer, wine, and even coffee in UAE, Qatar, and Bahrain are all among the most expensive. For cheaper drinks, travellers are spoilt for choice with options around the globe. The cheapest beers in the world can be found in Africa – just £0.88 (R16.21) per pint in Kampala, Uganda and £0.95 (R17.50) per pint in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania.
