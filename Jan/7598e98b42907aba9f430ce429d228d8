Vehicle evaluation group True Price has published a new report identifying the cars with the best resale value in South Africa at the end of 2019. The data is based on thousands of vehicles sold on auction around South Africa. These values are used to provide motorists with free vehicle evaluations. The company has data on thousands of vehicle auctions on its system. It then calculates the actual price achieved on auction as a percentage of the original list price to determine a resale value percentage. True Price’s data shows that Volkswagen is the biggest winner, with three vehicles in the top 10. Toyota and Kia each have two vehicles in the top 10, while Hyundai, Renault and Isuzu each have one vehicle on the list. Darryl Jacobson, managing director of True Price, said that the Tiguan’s victory would not be unexpected to anyone who attends bank repossession auctions. “It has been incredible to see the rise in popularity of this sports utility vehicle (SUV) over the past 12 months. “We’re seeing bidding like never before. It’s extremely popular with all age groups. This family-focused SUV boasts a spacious interior and faultless build quality. It is a brilliant car for soccer moms,” he said. Speaking on the Picanto, Jacobson said that that the car has been a hit with first-time buyers who are in need of an economical city vehicle. “Kia is a brand that has grown in reputation and stature – both globally and here in South Africa. This is proven by the JD Power 2019 Initial Quality Study, which ranked Genesis, Kia and Hyundai highest for the second straight year. Here in South Africa, Kia vehicles are also considered to be real quality acts. “With its attractive styling and funky colours, the Picanto is always a sure winner on auctions,” he said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-199730" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Picanto-2017.jpg" alt="" width="1598" height="1151" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Picanto-2017.jpg 1598w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Picanto-2017-300x216.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Picanto-2017-768x553.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Picanto-2017-1024x738.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Picanto-2017-1200x864.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Jacobson said that the third-place Polo Vivo remains the hatch of choice when South African motorists are shopping for an affordable vehicle. “It has an appealing price-tag, it’s a well-spec’d vehicle and it comes with the Volkswagen quality stamp of approval. It is an all-time favourite on the auction floor, with the traders knowing they can easily sell the vehicle,” he said. Read: Top 10 best-selling SUVs in South Africa right now – with prices
