Tracker has published its vehicle crime statistics for July to December 2019, showing an 18% decrease in the number of theft and hijackings reported nationally during December. The group said that this trend is consistent with year-on-year data, with an 18% decrease seen in December 2018 and a 21% decrease in December 2017. Tracker’s most recent data indicates that most vehicles are hijacked or stolen on a Saturday. This is followed by Thursday and Friday for hijackings and theft respectively. Most hijackings are reported between 20h00 and 21h00 followed by 12h00 and 14h00, on any day of the week, while theft of a vehicle is reported between 11h00 and 14h00. Gauteng has the highest percentage of vehicle-related crime (54%), with hijackings prevalent in Johannesburg and theft mainly occurring in Pretoria. This is followed by KwaZulu-Natal with Durban in the top spot for both hijackings and theft, and the Western Cape with hijackings mainly occurring in Khayelitsha while theft is highest in Cape Town. Further theft and hijacking hotspots include eMalahleni in Mpumalanga, Ibhayi in the Eastern Cape, Rustenburg in the North West, Polokwane in Limpopo and Bloemfontein in the Free State. While the Northern Cape has less than 1% of the total activations, hijackings are primarily reported in Postmasburg and theft in Kimberley. <img class="size-full wp-image-368236 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="805" height="2560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-scaled.jpg 805w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-94x300.jpg 94w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-322x1024.jpg 322w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-768x2443.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-483x1536.jpg 483w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Tracker-644x2048.jpg 644w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Tracker’s efforts to combat vehicle crime resulted in 3,081 vehicle recoveries, 512 arrests and 23 firearms recovered in the second half of 2019.
