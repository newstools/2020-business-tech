South African retail group Woolworths says that a constrained economy and power supply issues negatively impacted its operations in the half year period ending 29 December 2019 – but its food sales remained resilient. In a voluntary trading statement on Monday (27 January), the group warned that its headline earnings were expected to be 15% to 20% lower over the period, when compared to the comparable period before. The performance was due to the aforementioned trading conditions, and also reflected the group’s switch to IFRS 16 accounting standards, which includes the cost of leasing, often a large chunk of retailers’ operational costs, which was previously excluded. Excluding these costs would still see a decline, however, just lower at between 7.5% and 12.5% down on the previous period. “The 2019 financial year had a 53 week year, which resulted in a shift in trading weeks in 2020 compared to the prior financial year. This shift resulted in the Christmas week, including Boxing Day which is a significant trading day in Australia, falling into the first half of the current year compared to the second half of the prior year,” Woolworths noted. It expects headline earnings per share to be lower at 160.3 to 170.3 cents, versus 200.4 cents previously.
