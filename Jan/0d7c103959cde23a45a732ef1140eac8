Toyota has launched its revamped Corolla Quest in South Africa, boasting a facelift as well as a number of improvements in the cabin and under the hood. The biggest shift is the new 1.8-litre engine which produces 103 kW and 173 Nm at 4,000rpm. Toyota said that this change was made as it is standardised across its models globally versus the previously fitted 1.6-litre engine – providing cost and sourcing benefits. “One of the advantages of the 1.8-litre engine is that the torque figure is not only higher but also produced 1200 rpm earlier, compared to the 1.6. “This offers an enhanced driving experience – one of the key attributes customers identified in the research,” it said. Fuel consumption is listed as 7 litres/100km for manual models and 6.3 litres/100km for models equipped with the CVT option. Looking at the exterior, the front bumper has been given an updated treatment (grade dependent), replacing the gunmetal accent trims previously employed. The headlight trim also matches the radiator grille treatment (matte black vs colour), with the front fog lights now phased out. At the rear, the number plate garnish has been changed from chrome to body colour. <img class="size-full wp-image-369790 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-3.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-3.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-3-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-3-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-369792 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-5.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-5.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-5-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-5-768x511.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-369874 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-4.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-4.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-4-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Corolla-4-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Improved safety and features Toyota said that some of the biggest improvements in its new Quest model are additional safety features. “All Quest models now come with Driver, Passenger and driver-knee airbags – while the Prestige and Exclusive models receive side airbags too. “Vehicle Stability Control (VSC) with Hill Assist Control (HAC), ABS, EBD, Isofix, LED daytime running lights and rear fog lights are standard across the board.” All models also feature auto door-lock with remote operation, electric windows, air-conditioner, steering wheel switches, follow-me-home headlamps, radio/CD with USB, Aux and a minimum of four integrated speakers.
