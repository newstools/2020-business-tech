Location technology company TomTom has released the results of its latest Traffic Index, detailing the traffic data of 416 cities in 57 countries. Bengaluru takes the top spot this year with drivers in the southern Indian city expecting to spend an average of 71% extra travel time stuck in traffic. Next in the global rankings are Philippine capital, Manila (71%); Bogota in Colombia (68%); last year’s most congested city, Mumbai (65%); and Pune (59%), also in India. Tom Tom’s data shows that traffic congestion has increased globally during the last decade with only 63 cities showing measurable decreases year-on-year. This global increase in congestion, despite being an indicator of a strong economy, is understood to cost economies billions. “Globally, there’s a long road to travel until congestion levels are brought under control,” said Ralf-Peter Schäfer, TomTom’s vice president of Traffic Information. “In time, the rise of autonomous vehicles and car-sharing services will help alleviate congestion, but planners and policymakers can’t afford to sit and wait. They need to use all the tools available to them to analyse traffic levels and impacts, so they can make critical infrastructure decisions. “And drivers have a role to play too. Small changes in driving behaviours can make a huge difference.” <img class="size-full wp-image-368974 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic.png" alt="" width="844" height="626" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic.png 844w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic-300x223.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Traffic-768x570.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> South Africa Cairo in Egypt was named as the most congested city on the African continent, ranking 36th on the overall list. The rest of the African cities that feature on the index are all South African, with Cape Town named as the city with the worst traffic in the country (101st), followed by Johannesburg (121st) and Pretoria (207th). Tom Tom estimates that drivers in Cape Town and Johannesburg will both spend an average of 20-21 extra minutes per 30 minute trip in the morning stuck in traffic. You can likewise expect to spend an extra 20 minutes per 30 minute trip in the evening. This is roughly the equivalent of six days and 10 hours lost to traffic every year.  <img class="size-full wp-image-368990 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/South-Africa.png" alt="" width="808" height="440" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/South-Africa.png 808w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/South-Africa-300x163.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/South-Africa-768x418.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Cape Town <img class="size-full wp-image-368986 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-1.png" alt="" width="1045" height="769" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-1.png 1045w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-1-300x221.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-1-1024x754.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-1-768x565.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-368988 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-2.png" alt="" width="1016" height="602" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-2.png 1016w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-2-300x178.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Cape-2-768x455.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Joburg <img class="size-full wp-image-368982 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-1.png" alt="" width="1023" height="610" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-1.png 1023w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-1-300x179.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-1-768x458.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-368984 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-2.png" alt="" width="1013" height="593" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-2.png 1013w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-2-300x176.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Joburg-2-768x450.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Here’s where and when you are most likely to be hijacked in South Africa
