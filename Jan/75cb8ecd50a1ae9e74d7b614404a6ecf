National Treasury website: tips submission page Slow growth South Africa’s economic growth prospects are looking bleak, with the International Monetary Fund the latest to slash the country’s growth forecast for 2020. Following a year of load shedding, which cut economic growth in 2019 to a crawl, consensus among financial groups puts South Africa’s GDP growth outlook for 2020 below 1%. South Africa’s growth in 2019 was massively stunted by power outages through load shedding, which led to a major first quarter decline of 3.2%.
