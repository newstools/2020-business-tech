This is to restore the dignity of our people.” The school was previously built from asbestos which prompted a complete redesign and extension of its facilities.  The opening of Noordgesig Primary comes as the provincial Education Department marks the first year where it will implement the newly gazetted Admissions Regulations, as per the Constitutional Court ruling. Through this regulation, the Gauteng Department of Education is responsible for admissions of learners at public ordinary schools. However, the planned system was off to the rough start and Lesufi said that his department was facing capacity problems around student spaces. As a result, the GDE has turned to private schools to assist with learner placement, he said. “Unfortunately, we can only accommodate a certain number of learners at our schools and as such, we call upon parents to accept placement offers as these are the only spaces available at some schools,” he said. “To mitigate the capacity challenges, the GDE is in the final stages of finalising a partnership with Curro to accommodate learners at their schools. “We are also interacting with other private schools to assist us.” Read: Gauteng in talks with private schools as it battles for student space
