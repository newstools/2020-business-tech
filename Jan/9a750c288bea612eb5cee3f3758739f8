The JDA said that construction on the project is currently 85% complete and will include a 50,000 square metre international long distance and cross border transport and shopping hub. 3,300 sqm of the total space is devoted to retail including large retail outlets, banks, ticketing offices, food courts and informal traders. The facility will also include a bus terminal for cross-border buses as well as ranking and holding space for 648 taxis and 20 buses. Security of the facility will be managed from a control room equipped with a building management system, including CCTV cameras and access control. <img class="size-full wp-image-369536 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-369540 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-4-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-369538 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3.jpg" alt="" width="1920" height="1080" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3.jpg 1920w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/JDA-3-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “The City of Johannesburg continues to experience an increase in demand for road space,” said member of the mayoral committee for Transport, Nonhlanhla Makhuba. “The state-of-the-art JITI will be one of the critical projects which will ensure that efficient mass public transport networks and connections, transit-orientated multi-use precincts, together with strategic land-use planning and zoning regimes are realised so we connect our people to opportunities to live, work and play in the city.” Makhuba said that the construction of this project is also playing a role in job creation and skills development, with 30% of the contract value being awarded to SMMEs. A total of 18 SMMEs and 34 local labourers were appointed for the execution of the portions of the works in the infrastructure project. The project, which is expected to be completed in May 2020, will be handed over to the City’s Department of Transport on completion. Read: South African businesses are struggling to stay afloat
