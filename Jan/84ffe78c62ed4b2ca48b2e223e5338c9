Eskom will implement stage 2 load shedding on Sunday (5 January) and early Monday morning as it battles with system failures. The power utility announced cuts on Saturday evening due to an unanticipated conveyor belt failure at its Medupi power station. “While a number of units are being brought back online following repairs and maintenance, it is essential to implement Stage 2 load shedding. “This is in order to help us replenish both our water levels at pumped storage schemes and diesel for our open-cycle gas turbines in order to create adequate reserve capacity to place us an in a better position to stabilise for the week ahead as South Africa returns to work,” it said in a statement. The latest load-shedding announcement follows a report that Eskom wants R1.8 billion in performance bonuses for staff. Earlier this week, energy expert Ted Blom warned that load shedding may be a reality for at least the next five years as Eskom sorts out its coal problems and its maintenance backlog.
