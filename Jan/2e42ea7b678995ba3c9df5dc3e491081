The auditing firm said that bursaries are awarded to students with an outstanding academic track record at school and/or university.

Bursaries are also awarded on the condition that when you complete your studies successfully, you will be required to work for PwC on a training contract, gaining hands-on experience in the business. Requirements include: For matrics: You must have a minimum of a Level 6 in Mathematics and English (1st or 2nd language), and an overall average of 70%.
You must be intending to study full-time at a SAICA accredited institution
