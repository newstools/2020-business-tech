Pick n Pay will now offer flight booking and travel ticket services in-store, in partnership with Travelstart. The partnership brings travel to the host of other value added services the retail group offers. Customers can pay for their bills, withdraw cash, transfer money and buy event tickets from shops across the country. One of the most notable partnerships in the past year was the launch of TymeBank, which currently services one million customers through kiosks at Pick n Pay stores. Richard van Rensburg, CIO at Pick n Pay, said the partnership with Travelstart is one of the new ways the retailer wants to bring innovative services to shopper, and make travel more accessible and convenient for customers. “We know our customers have busy lives, so we’ve incorporated various value-added services under one roof for them to create one seamless shopping experience,” he said. “Travelstart digitally reaches millions of consumers each year. By partnering with Pick n Pay, we are now able to provide extra value to our customers by giving them the additional option of booking their flights and bus tickets in store,” said Jerome Touze, MD of Travelstart. “Pick n Pay is an outstanding brand to be associated with and we could not be more excited to embark upon this new partnership.” Read: More South Africans are going meat-free, say Checkers and Pick n Pay
