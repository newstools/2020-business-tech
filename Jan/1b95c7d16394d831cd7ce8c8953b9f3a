Volkswagen Group South Africa (VWSA) dominated the passenger car market in South Africa in 2019, with 89,353 vehicles sold. The group said that its passenger brand achieved its highest market share since 1996 of 20.4%, while Audi ended the year with an improved market share of 18.2%. Mike Glendinning, director: sales and marketing, VWSA, said: “2019 was an incredible year for VWSA. Not only did the Uitenhage factory produce a record 161,954 vehicles, surpassing the previous record of 137,758 vehicles produced in 2011, VWSA also ended the year with 23.4% passenger market share (up 0.6% from 2018), meaning that close to a quarter of all cars sold in the South African market are from the Volkswagen Group.” According to the National Association of Automobile Manufacturers of South Africa (NAAMSA), South Africa recorded domestic sales of 536,626 units in 2019, a decline of 15,601 units or 2.8%. The Polo Vivo was the best-selling passenger car in South Africa with 29,619 vehicles sold in 2019. The locally-manufactured model topped the A0 segment with a share of 24.5%. The Volkswagen Passenger brand also ended 2019 with a record-market share of 20.4% (0.6% improvement from 2018), the highest since 1996. Premium brand Audi sold 8,495 vehicles in 2019 and ended off the year with a market share of 18.2%, which is up from the 17% market share achieved in 2018. The brand’s best-selling vehicle was the Audi A3 Sportback with 1,826 vehicles sold last year. Looking ahead, VWSA said that 2020 will be an exciting year for the company, with key model introductions for Volkswagen and Audi in South Africa. This year, Volkswagen will launch the T-Cross 1.5 TSI 110kW and 70kW models, the T-Roc (Volkswagen’s sporty premium SUV which slots between the T-Cross and Tiguan), the special-edition Golf GTI TCR which will see only 300 units sold in South Africa, the all-new Golf 8 as well as a facelift in the T6 Commercial Vehicles range. The T-Cross 1.5 TSI 110kW model is already on the road, with the 70kW model expected later in the year. VWSA said that 2020 will be an eventful year for the Audi brand with the introduction of new models like the all-new Audi Q3 Sportback, Audi A6 Sedan and Audi’s first fully electric vehicle, the Audi e-tron. In addition the Audi A4, A5, Q7 and R8 model ranges along with their high performance derivatives receive product improvements or facelifts this year. Audi’s S/RS performance vehicle portfolio will be bolstered with the new RS6, RS7, RSQ3, RSQ8 and the S8.
