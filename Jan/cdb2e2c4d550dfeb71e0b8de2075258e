Eskom said it will implement stage 2 load shedding early on Wednesday morning (8 January) to accommodate the release of matric results. In a statement, the embattled power utility said the load shedding will take place from 01h00 to 06h00 to maximise electricity availability during the working day. Eskom said that it has also chosen this time to accommodate learners awaiting their matric results. “To give matriculants an opportunity to receive their matric results, the implementation of stage 2 load shedding has been delayed to 01h00on Wednesday morning. “The decision will also allow the matriculants enough time to make their way home safely. “Owing to a loss of additional generation capacity, emergency reserves had to be extensively utilised to supplement capacity during the day.”  Eskom said that its engineers were working tirelessly to fix the issue and that it would provide regular updates on the outages. The company was able to avert power cuts for much of the festive period as many businesses closed during the holiday, however, it was forced to implement stage 2 load shedding again over the past weekend. Businesses are expected to return by mid-January, which will increase the demand for electricity. “The system remains constrained and vulnerable, and as such load-shedding stage 2 will, unfortunately, have to continue,” Eskom said.
