MTN says that it has completed a comprehensive review of the group strategy with a focus on accelerating growth, deleveraging the holding company debt and unlocking value. The revised strategy will be presented in more detail following the release of MTN’s 2020 full-year results in March 2021, it said. MTN Group announced the appointment of a new chief financial officer (GCFO) as well as changes to the company’s regional structure and the group exco. “We are pleased to announce the appointment of Tsholofelo Molefe as the new GCFO. Tsholofelo will take up the position as soon as practically possible in 2021, but by no later than 1 October 2021,” it said in a statement. Molefe is a qualified chartered accountant, CA(SA), and brings deep financial, risk and telecommunications experience, the company said. “As Telkom’s GCFO since 2018, as well as its chief risk officer and deputy CFO prior to that, Tsholofelo played a key role in the strategic transformation programmes at Telkom.” Prior to working at Telkom, Molefe was the finance director at Eskom as well as the CFO for First National Bank’s Personal Banking division. She is also a non-executive director on the board of Curro Holdings. Molefe will also join the group board and take over from Sugentharan Perumal who has been acting in the position of GCFO since 1 September 2020.
