Security group Fidelity has announced a partnership with Vumacam to roll out an extensive surveillance network of cameras across Gauteng. “Vumacam cameras are fibre-connected to Vumacam’s advanced Teraco tier-4 datacentre and the feed is streamed in real-time to the Fidelity command and control centre where it is stored securely for 30 days,” said Wahl Bartmann, chief executive for Fidelity Services Group. Bartmann said that the technology allows for data privacy while allowing for integrated analytics on flagged crime incidents across all Vumacam cameras nationally. The partnership between the two companies began with the roll-out of the smart camera network across a number of Southern suburbs earlier this year. The initial project saw the Bassonia, Glenvista, Mulbarton and Glenanda areas benefit from 27 strategically-positioned poles with 27 License Plate recognition (LPR) cameras and 54 overview cameras. “By the end of December we will have rolled out 1,400 LPR’s across Gauteng,” said Bartmann. He said that this is part of a contracted solution to residential communities and commercial customers – including businesses, smallholdings, estates and shopping malls. The increased coverage will support Fidelity’s broader crime prevention efforts, he said. “The increase in crime has prompted many residents to take a more proactive stance regarding their local security requirements. “They believe there is a need to look to solutions that coordinate law enforcement and private security company solutions to effectively deal with criminal activity in their areas of residence. The same applies to many of our commercial customers,” he said. Read: Crime in South Africa – what the official stats don’t tell you
