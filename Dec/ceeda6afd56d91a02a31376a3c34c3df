Pam Golding has launched its digital edition of Exquisite, its collection of some of the most prestigious properties in South Africa. According to the real estate specialist, the luxury property market is showing encouraging signs of growing activity, “and it is also at its most competitive pricing in over a decade”. The realtor has a number of luxury properties listed as for sale, ranging between R9 million and R59 million, but also includes a number of high-value rentals stretching as far as R330,000 per month. Of the rental listings, two come in at R100,000 per month – one located in the upmarket Saddlebrook Estate, just north of Joburg near Midrand, and one in the Steenberg Estate in Tokai, just outside Constantia, Cape Town. Both residences offer luxurious living to those who can afford the steep monthly fee to stay there.

The buildings cover 1,600 square metres on a 11,000 square metre property, and is fitted and is fitted and suited for entertaining. “The entire home functions off ELAN Home Automation, and features a custom fitted bar with ambient lighting for first class entertaining,” Pam Golding said.
