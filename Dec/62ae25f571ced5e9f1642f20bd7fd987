Basic Education minister Angie Motshekga says that her department will undertake a full audit of its systems to ensure that no more matric exam papers are leaked going forward. The Department of Basic Education (DBE) planned to make matric students re-write their maths and science papers after the exams leaked early, giving rise to security concerns. While the Gauteng High Court has set aside the move to rewrite, there are still concerns about the quality of the final results of the 2020 national senior exams. Responding in a written parliamentary Q&A, Motshekga said that her department was taking steps to ensure that similar leak do not happen going forward, including a review of the technologies being used in the exams process. “In terms of ensuring that this does not happen in the future, the Department has commenced with an audit of the entire value chain from origination of question papers to the delivery of question papers to examination centres,” she said. “The purpose of this audit is to establish the weak points in the system with a view to strengthening these weak points and the security will be doubled at all points in the system.” Motshekga said that the DBE will also appoint an independent investigator to conduct a comprehensive audit of the entire examination system. “(This will be) inclusive of the Information Technology systems that are used to evaluate what new technologies can be utilised in future years to improve and modernise the examination system,” she said. Matric exams will conclude on 15 December, with marking expected to be completed on 22 January 2021, and the results released on 23 February 2021. The 2021 school year will start on 25 January for teachers, and a few days later for learners on 27 January. Read: Updated school calendars show slow return to ‘normal’ in South Africa
