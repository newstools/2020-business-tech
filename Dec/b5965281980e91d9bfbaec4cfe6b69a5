The latest index from jobs portal CareerJunction shows that hiring activity in South Africa is flat as we see out the year – but several skills are still in strong demand by those companies who are hiring. The CareerJunction Index (CJI) represents online labour dynamics in South Africa by providing a detailed analysis of the relative ratio of supply and demand in the online job market. The index is unchanged at 94 points in November, indicating that there is still increased competition in the job search market. An index score below 100 indicates that there are fewer job opportunities and more job seekers, making it a highly competitive environment for those looking for work. However, the uptick does show that more work is becoming available, and recruiters are actively looking to fill positions. There has been an increase in hiring activity for job seekers in the ICT, sales, architecture & engineering, marketing, business & management, warehousing & logistics sectors over the last three months, the group said. Software developers remain highly sought after in the local job market. More than 1,000 vacancies were allocated to software developers during November 2020, CareerJunction said. After a dip in demand during lockdown level 5, hiring activity for middle and department managers is recovering strongly. Since May, demand for managerial skills has more than doubled. Hiring activity for sales representatives is growing significantly. Over the past three months, demand for sales representatives and consultants increased by 44%.

When looking at active job seekers across various sectors, areas of high supply correlate closely to those in high demand, however supply outstrips demand in some cases, leading to a competitive environment for job seekers. “There has been an uptake in hiring activity for professionals in the ICT, sales, architecture & engineering, marketing, business & management, warehousing & logistics sectors over the last 3 months. Demand for ICT and sales professionals has been increasing continuously over the last 6 months,” CareerJunction said. A fluctuating recruitment trend is evident for professionals in the finance, medical & health, admin, office & support, manufacturing & assembly sectors. Demand for medical & health professionals is expected to increase in the near future due to the growing number of Covid-19 cases, the group said.
