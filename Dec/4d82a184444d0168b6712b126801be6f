Apple Inc shares briefly rallied to an intraday record on Tuesday, continuing a year-end surge that’s cementing its lead over Amazon.com Inc as 2020’s best performer among the largest technology stocks. Apple has advanced 13% in December amid signs of strong demand for its iPhone 12 models and optimism about its self-driving car efforts. The gains propelled Apple past Amazon with an 84% rally in 2020 compared to Amazon’s 80% increase. The S&P 500 is up 15% this year. Wall Street has grown increasingly bullish on Apple’s prospects in the coming year with analysts projecting that a recovering economy will fuel even more demand for iPhones, wearables such as Airpods and services. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-458496" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bloomberg10.png" alt="" width="924" height="507" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bloomberg10.png 924w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bloomberg10-300x165.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bloomberg10-768x421.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Apple’s revenue growth is expected to increase to 15% in fiscal 2021 from 6% in 2020, and profit growth is projected to double to 20%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.
