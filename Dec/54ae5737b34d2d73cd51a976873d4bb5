Vodacom has launched its 5G network in key municipal districts across KwaZulu-Natal. The 5G network is currently available on 156 live 5G sites across the KwaZulu-Natal province and supports both mobile and fixed wireless access services. Vodacom said that its customers with 5G-enabled devices, and within a 5G coverage area, are now able to access the new 5G network in KwaZulu-Natal. “Critically, the latest mobile networking technology will ultimately help the region bridge the digital divide between the urban and rural areas of the province by extending access to affordable mobile broadband, especially as an alternative to fibre connectivity in underserviced township areas,” the network provider said. Vodacom launched its 5G mobile network in three cities in May 2020 – Johannesburg, Pretoria and Cape Town. This network supports both mobile and fixed wireless services and is currently available in Gauteng and in Cape Town. The group said that it will further accelerate 5G network rollout after additional 5G spectrum is auctioned at the end of March 2021. “Vodacom now offers the widest 5G network coverage in KwaZulu-Natal and we expect to expand our national 5G footprint significantly once we get access to new spectrum,” said Vodacom South Africa chief executive Balesh Sharma. “We are confident that the rollout of 5G will help us to bridge South Africa’s digital divide in the long-term by promoting digital inclusion. “As a more efficient technology than its predecessors, 5G is designed to more efficiently meet the rapidly increasing connectivity requirements of modern society. “The widespread rollout of 5G will support Government’s 4IR objectives in future, and will facilitate the creation of an entirely new technologically enabled world.” Read: Telkom launches WhatsApp payment service
