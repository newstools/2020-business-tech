Retailer Pick n Pay says it will extend its Black Friday sales until 6 December. John Bradshaw, retail executive: marketing at Pick n Pay said that many customers had elected to focus on grocery basics to restock their pantries and freezers, and prepare for Christmas. “Our extended Black Friday deals this week means that SASSA grant recipients and customers who get paid later in the month, can still shop our great Black Friday deals that offer up to 50% savings on essential food items.” Bradshaw said that everyday groceries that sold well this year include long-life milk, frozen chicken, cooking oil, rice, washing powder, and toilet paper. Additional in-store safety measures are in place for customers, and these will be in place for the full two weeks’ duration of Pick n Pay’s Black Friday sale, he said. “Our online shop and same-day delivery service with Bottles have been very busy as customers opt to shop their favourite Black Friday deals at speed from the convenience of their homes. “Customers are now more comfortable and confident with online shopping after using the services regularly during lockdown,” he said.
