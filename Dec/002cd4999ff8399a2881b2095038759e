President Cyril Ramaphosa will address the nation at 20h00 on Monday evening (14 December) regarding developments related to South Africa’s Covid-19 response. The address follows meetings with the National Coronavirus Command Council and provincial governments as the country battles with the impact of a second coronavirus wave. President Cyril Ramaphosa is expected to announce strict new lockdown restrictions in South Africa as a way of curbing rising infection rates. However, a member of the president’s executive told City Press that it is unlikely that the entire country will return to a hard lockdown as experienced earlier this year. Instead, higher restrictions are set to be introduced at a localised level in the country’s coronavirus hotspot areas. The additional restrictions which are being considered include: Stricter curfew times;
Earlier closing times for restaurants;
Further limitations on gatherings such as funerals
New rules around beaches.  South Africa reported 7,882 new cases on Saturday, taking the cumulative total of Covid-19 cases in the country to 852,965. The country reported 154 more deaths, taking the total to 23,106, while recoveries now stand at 760,118. It follows in excess of 8,000 new cases on Friday. During his previous national address, Ramaphosa identified three areas in South Africa that were of particular concern for a sharp rise in the number of new infections: Nelson Mandela Bay (EC); The Garden Route (WC); and Sarah Baartman District (EC).
