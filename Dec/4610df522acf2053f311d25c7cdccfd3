DStv has launched a standalone streaming service where customers can subscribe and watch all channels via the DStv app, without a decoder or satellite connection. Announced earlier this year, DStv streaming allows for existing and new customers to access content on their preferred device including smartphones, tablets, gaming consoles or smart televisions. The device should be linked to a consistent, high-speed internet connection for an optimum viewing experience, DStv said. Previously, customers could only subscribe to DStv through a satellite connection, including a decoder to access DStv’s content. DStv streaming allows customers to choose any one of its residential packages. The current packages available for streaming are: DStv Premium;
DStv Compact Plus;
DStv Compact;
DStv Family;
DStv Acces;
DStv EasyView. Streaming customers can also watch shows on Catch Up on four devices, with a maximum of two concurrent streams. “We are led by our customers’ evolving viewing habits and how and when they choose to access our content. “The option to use the internet to consume content speaks to how DStv continues to diversify its offerings with a clear intention to drive value and convenience for our customers,” said Nyiko Shiburi, chief executive of MultiChoice South Africa. Current DStv customers on select packages retain the access to DStv’s streaming service they have long enjoyed as a value-added service.
