The Wildlife & Environment Society of South Africa (WESSA) has announced that 58 Blue Flags will be flown at 48 beaches, six marinas and by four sustainable tourism boats around South Africa over the forthcoming 2020/21 Blue Flag season. Nineteen Pilot sites received recognition for their efforts in working towards the minimum requirements for Blue Flag Status. The Blue Flag programme is focused on the conservation of marine and coastal habitats, and is designed to raise environmental education and awareness, and increase sound environmental practices among tourists, local populations and beach management. To achieve Blue Flag status, as many as 33 different criteria spanning four aspects of coastal management must be met and maintained: water quality, environmental education and information, environmental management, and safety and services.
