Discovery Vitality has announced a new partnership with Strava, a digital community for cyclists and runners, with over 73 million athletes on the platform. “We’re very pleased to partner with Vitality to help provide motivation and camaraderie for their members,” said Michael Horvath, chief executive and co-founder at Strava. “Discovery Vitality has always embraced technology as a tool for changing behaviour for good. It’s helped us make over a million South African members and 20 million global members healthier,” said Dinesh Govender, Vitality SA chief executive officer. Vitality members will now be able to connect, compete and get rewarded with Strava, earning up to 100 Vitality points for each activity. Members will have wider access to running and cycling opportunities, enjoy a sense of community that attracts more people into the culture of fitness and exchange accounts of their experiences to get themselves and their teammates enthused about running and cycling, it said. To date, Strava has had more than 4 billion activities uploaded from every country on earth and seen an average of 2 million athletes join every 30 days. Strava turns members’ smartphone device into a running and cycling computer, so they can track and analyse every aspect of their physical activity. The platform also allows members to connect with friends across the globe. It is also home to the world’s largest route and trail resources for runners and cyclists, allowing members to explore new routes and compete with a global community. “This collaboration with Strava is testament to our deep commitment to give our members greater reasons to get healthy. Despite the challenges we have collectively faced in 2020, we look to 2021 with renewed hope, energy and excitement about what this partnership with Strava will mean for our members and society alike,” said Vitality head of Wellness Dr Mosima Mabunda.
