Huawei has announced that it will launch its mobile payment service in South Africa on 3 December. Huawei Pay will be integrated with Zapper and supports debit and credit cards across all of South Africa’s top banks. Huawei will be adding tap-to-pay functionality to the solution soon, added the company. Smartphone owners can download the Huawei Wallet app through the Huawei AppGallery, and then use the Huawei Pay service to make purchases at South African retailers. To use this service, customers simply need to scan their Zapper QT payment code on their bill at checkout. Huawei Pay therefore does not use your bank card number to handle your payments, nor is this information stored on your device or by Huawei. Huawei Consumer Business Group VP for South Africa Likun Zhao said the company is happy to launch Huawei Pay in partnership with Zapper in South Africa. “With Huawei Pay, you add your bank cards to the app and then pay in stores simply by scanning the Zapper QR payment code on the bill when you check out,” said Zhao. “It’s a simple and convenient payment solution that we know will make the lives of South African consumers easier.” Zapper CEO Brett White believes the partnership between Huawei and Zapper is a big step in the right direction for the local market. “Huawei is a favourite among a large portion of smartphone owners in South Africa and equipping them with access to Zapper’s scan-to-pay platform will empower them to make fast, safe payments across the country,” said White. “By putting the Zapper solution in the hands of millions of South African consumers, many more merchants can now also confidently offer cashless transactions.” “It is clear this partnership is a win for the local mobile payments market and we look forward to continued innovation together.” This article was published in partnership with Huawei.
