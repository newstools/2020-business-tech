New global research commissioned by Kaspersky of 8,000 SMB workers across multiple industries has revealed that three quarters of employees (78%) in South Africa want to rethink pre-Covid-19 ways of working. Instead of returning to business as usual, workers are now shaping a future of business on their terms, whether that’s spending more time with loved ones (65%), saving money (68%), or working remotely (50%). Suddenly faced with an overwhelmingly remote workforce, business leaders now need to adapt fast to remain secure and resilient, whilst employees are using this moment of change as an opportunity to reassess yesterday’s priorities, and plan a future around what really matters to them. ‘ And as work and home lives are transformed, it’s employees who now see themselves in the driving seat. In casting off the shackles of previously rigid job routines, employees worldwide are rethinking the next normal for work, inspiring more agile, accommodating, and humane work cultures. Moving forward, 52% of workers in South Africa want to leave behind the 9-5 working structure – and 36% are ready to see the back of fixed office desks, while 41% want to end the five-day working week. The research also highlighted that 50% of employees locally see remote working as the third greatest benefit which comes as a by-product of the novel Coronavirus, after saving money (68%) and spending time with family (65%). In fact, most of the advantages revolve around pursuing new opportunities for personal enrichment outside of work, as getting that work-life balance becomes even more important. Yet as employees continue to embrace more forward-thinking and flexible ways of working, it is critical that businesses augment and adapt the support they provide. Given that half (50%) of the workforce locally actively seeks more technology support from their organisation when working remotely, the need to provide the tools and technology to keep users productive, connected and secure has never been greater. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-449185" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kaspersky.png" alt="" width="603" height="385" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kaspersky.png 603w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kaspersky-300x192.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Alexander Moiseev, Chief Business Officer at Kaspersky, said: “We are facing a defining moment in time, and this is very exciting.
