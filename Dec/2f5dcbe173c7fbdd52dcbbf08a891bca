The Rosebank store is the latest to form part of Checkers’ FreshX brand which aims to take on upmarket retailers such as Woolworths. The FreshX concept stores were introduced by Checkers as a way for the company to gain market share among more affluent South Africans, with the idea proving so popular that the group now plans to revamp at least a third of its Checkers stores to the new look in the medium term. Unlike traditional Checkers stores, the FreshX concept stores feature more upmarket furniture and signage – including benches and tables for customers to test samples. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-454520" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rose-Bank-2.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="1348" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rose-Bank-2.jpg 598w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Rose-Bank-2-200x300.jpg 200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Checkers Rosebank is the fifth supermarket from the retailer to open in Gauteng within the space of a month, creating more than 200 new jobs. The new stores – located in areas not previously served by the Shoprite Group’s supermarkets or in those showing population growth – include: Checkers Clubview (Centurion);
Checkers Magalies (Brits, North West) ;
Checkers Village View at the Village View Shopping Centre (Bedfordview);
Checkers Castle Gate at the Castle Gate Shopping Centre (Waterkloof Ridge, Pretoria);
Checkers Rosebank at Rosebank Mall. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-448821" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Starbucks-Checkers.jpg" alt="" width="900" height="560" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Starbucks-Checkers.jpg 598w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Starbucks-Checkers-300x187.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> In November, Checkers announced a new partnership with Starbucks which will see the coffee house and roastery chain launch outlets in select supermarkets. Over the course of December, Starbucks will open at the new Checkers FreshX supermarkets in Rosebank and Stellenbosch, where customers can enjoy a selection of handcrafted, premium beverages tailored to their personal needs, the retailer said.
