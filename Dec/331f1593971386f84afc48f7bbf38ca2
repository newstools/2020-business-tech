Woolworths has announced the trial launch of its new same-day delivery service – Woolies Dash. The service will give customers access to fast delivery of Woolworths quality groceries, including a wide range of fresh produce, pantry staples and household essentials directly off the shelves, the retailer said. “We have seen a marked growth of our online sales in the past 12 months. Woolies Dash complements our already expansive online service, from our scheduled delivery service with broad regional footprint, to our drive-through click and collect service, and now our same-day service with Woolies Dash,” said Liz Hillock, Woolworths head of Online and Mobile. Woolies Dash will open the trial service in 18 stores in Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban, Hillock said. “The trial will give our loyal customers the opportunity to try the service and give us feedback, while we perfect the offering. “Our customers are keen to get access to the service sooner rather than later, so we’re bringing them on the journey with us. We’re offering free delivery as part of the trial, as a thank-you for helping us enhance the service.” Hillock said that Woolies Dash will be available as a separate app to start with. To trial the service, customers can download the Woolies Dash app from the iOS or Android store. Woolies Dash will be available to customers situated within 5km of the following stores during the trial; Western Cape: V&A Waterfront, Canal Walk, Cavendish, Gardens, Cape Gate, Blue Route, Tygervalley;
Gauteng: Cresta, Clearwater Mall, Norwood Mall, Menlyn, Dainfern Square, The Grove, Lynnwood Road, Benmore Gardens, The Glen;
