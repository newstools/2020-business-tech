Tauriq Keraan is the chief executive officer at TymeBank, the new revolutionary digital retail banking entrant in South Africa’s financial services landscape. Keraan previously served as the bank’s deputy chief executive, before taking over the lead role in 2019. He has played an instrumental role in the bank’s development, being one of the founding members that led to Tyme’s inception in 2012, while also playing a critical role in the market launch of TymeBank in 2019. Keraan has an MSc degree from the University of Cape Town and has for the last decade, built and scaled digital banking businesses in South Africa. TymeBank now reaches over 2.5 million customers, with its latest offering – a secure contactless card payments solution to offset the increasing risks around the Covid-19 virus. In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Keraan talks about the value of strong leadership in a time of crisis, heightened in 2020 by the Covid-19 pandemic. He talks about the challenges created by the pandemic around productivity and mental health – particularly in a fragmented working environment – using the example of the ability of test cricketers to ‘switch off’ during a long innings. He also highlights the shifts seen among the bank’s clients during the last six months, and the lessons the bank has learnt from this difficult year. The full interview is embedded below.
