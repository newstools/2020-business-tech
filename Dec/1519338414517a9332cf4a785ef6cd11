President Cyril Ramaphosa has announced new lockdown measures at both a national and district level. In a national address on Monday evening (14 December), the president said that the country has been hit by a second wave of coronavirus infections with nearly 8,000 new cases reported on Sunday (13 December). He said that if action is not taken, there is a likelihood that this second wave could be worse than the first, adding that four provinces are leading this second wave, including: The Western Cape
The Eastern Cape
KZN
Gauteng Ramaphosa said that most cases are reported in young people between 15 and 19 years. He said that one of the main reasons for the massive spike in infections are social gatherings and parties- particularly the matric rage event. At many of these parties, the president that social distancing is not being observed, venues are often overcrowded, they are not ventilated, hand sanitisers are not available, and people are not wearing masks. He said that many people consume alcohol at these events meaning people are less cautious than they should be. “We now know that nearly 1,000 young people from Gauteng who attended the event have tested positive for the coronavirus. What we don’t yet know is how many more people each of them has infected. “It is said that up to 300 families could in turn have been infected. The sad truth about is that festivals, concerts & parties – which should be occasions for fun & joy – are proving to be sources of infection & illness and may even lead to deaths.” Other reasons behind the rise infections include increased travel between provinces and a relaxed attitude to current lockdown regulations such as wearing masks. “The festive season is now the greatest threat to the health and wellbeing of our people. It also places a threat to the recovery of our economy,” he said. Local restrictions Ramaphosa said that it is necessary to take extraordinary measures to save lives, while still protecting livelihoods. These measures include local lockdown restrictions for the Sarah Baartman District in the Eastern Cape and the Garden Route District in the Western Cape, which have been declared hotpot regions. From 00h01 on Tuesday, until a drop in infections is seen, the following additional restrictions will take affect in these areas: Hours of curfew will be from 22h00 – 04h00 except for essential workers and emergencies;
