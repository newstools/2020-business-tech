The Council for Medical Schemes (CMS) has published its 2019/20 annual report, detailing the membership numbers and financial status of South Africa’s open and restricted medical aid schemes. The CMS regulated 78 registered medical schemes in 2019, a decrease from 79 as a result of a merger between Resolution Health Medical Scheme and Spectramed to form Health Squared Medical Scheme. These 78 medical schemes comprised of 20 open schemes and 58 restricted schemes. Open schemes accounted for 55.38% of the medical scheme beneficiaries. These schemes have 4.05 million registered members, serving a total of 8.94 million beneficiaries. Principal members covered an average of 1.20 dependents, decreasing from 1.32 in 2018. The gender distribution of members was also almost equal in all schemes, although the average age for females was higher with 34.1 versus 31.9 in male members. Medical scheme members are ageing, with average age across schemes being 33 years, up from 32.8 in 2018. Based on principal member addresses, approximately 40% of all medical schemes members were in Gauteng, followed by the Western Cape, and KwaZulu-Natal with 15% and 14% respectively.
