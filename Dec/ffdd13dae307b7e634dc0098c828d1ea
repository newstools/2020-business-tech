In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Bodley talks through the restructure of Dimension Data before the onset of Covid-19, which he says led to another pause and rethink for the company, ‘on how to remain relevant’. He highlights the lessons he has learned from the virus and resultant lockdown, notably how adaptable humans and organisations can be. Bodley also explains how Dimension Data expects to take advantage of the acceleration to digital during the pandemic, while also committing to the country through its data centre expansion plans.
