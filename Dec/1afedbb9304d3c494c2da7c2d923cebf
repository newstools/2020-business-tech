Despite 2020 being a challenging and economically turbulent environment, money manager Sygnia said on Tuesday (8 December) that it increased assets under management and administration by 5.6% to R251.8 billion for the financial period ended September 2020. During the same period, it noted that the FTSE/JSE All Share Index returned 2%, the JSE All Bond Composite Index 3.6% and the MSCI World Index, in rands, 21.6%. “The growth has also taken place in an environment where the institutional savings market is shrinking by virtue of almost negligible economic growth, corporate closures and mass retrenchments in South Africa,” it said. The company, led by Magda Wierzycka, pointed to a mixture of low-cost strategies and a strong focus on macroeconomic trends, for its active asset allocation decisions. “Our top performance has been a strong factor behind our growing presence in the retail market. In addition, the Group has launched new products and services in line with its interpretation of customers’ demands and regulatory trends, contributing to the growth in its revenue.” In terms of financial performance, total revenues, at R661 million, climbed by 30.1% (2019: R508.1 million), while total expenses, at R381.9 million, increased by 12.5% (2019: R339.4 million). The increase in expenses was primarily driven by higher staff costs associated with increased business activity, an increase in trading, custody and administration costs and marketing expenditure.

Global investors will demand higher rates of return to loan money to South Africa, and South Africa will in turn have to borrow ever-increasing amounts to repay interest on the debt due.” It said that spending needs for social programmes will also increase due to rising unemployment, stressed schooling and health systems and electricity generation. “We do not believe South Africa is at the point of becoming a failed state just yet, but we are in the final minutes of the game, and there is now no room for error or equivocation. “Without growth, South Africa will remain mired in a debt crisis, with the inevitable result being a trip to the International Monetary Fund and the unpalatable austerity measures they will attach to any loans given.” A strong social compact is in the making between labour, business and government, which could pave the way to success. Sygnia said that if South Africa is to avoid a debt trap, it must throw off the shackles of corruption. “In short, while we recognise that the South African economy is on a precipice, it can still step back by cutting spending, investing for growth and creating the jobs that will help the nation fulfil the potential we know it possesses. “A number of positive catalysts have raised the prospects for global growth in 2021, including the Biden presidency, the 14th Chinese 5 year plan, a weaker dollar and the successful phase 3 trials of a number of vaccines. As a small open commodity producing economy, South Africa is geared to global growth, particularly in China, and these improved prospects offer a glimmer of hope for 2021.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-455508" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sygnia1.png" alt="" width="717" height="385" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sygnia1.png 717w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Sygnia1-300x161.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Large asset managers are blocking South Africans from investing overseas: Sygnia chief executive
