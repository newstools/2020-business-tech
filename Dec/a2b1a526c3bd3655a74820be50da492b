Domestic airline Kulula will resume flights on Tuesday (1 December) after a months-long delay caused by the coronavirus lockdown and a business rescue process which impacted its parent group Comair. To ensure a smooth transition to resuming operations, Comair will be operating a limited schedule, with limited aircraft during December 2020. The aircraft will gradually return to service from December 2020, with a seven-month ramp-up period until June 2021. Kulula said it will operate all domestic routes, with the exception of the Durban/Cape Town and Lanseria routes, which will be added as more aircraft become available. British Airways, operated by Comair, will open its domestic flights later in December.  Comair’s resumption of flights will be headed up by a new chief executive after the current boss, Wrenelle Stander, resigned from her position with immediate effect on Monday. The airline group announced the appointment of Glenn Orsmond as its new chief executive officer, and the appointment of Kirsten King as chief financial officer. Discovery Discovery has also announced that Vitality members can now book Kulula flights using their membership. While the Kulula booking platform has been live for several weeks for accommodation, car hire and select international flight bookings, the reintroduction of local air travel bookings is now also available. Discovery said that Vitality members can make new bookings for domestic flights with kulula.com and international Emirates and Qantas flights through the Kulula website. British Airways flight bookings will open in due course, it said. Read: Emirates partners with FlySafair in fresh push into South Africa
