The Department of Basic Education has announced that the matric class of 2020 will have to rewrite two exam papers, after they were leaked hours before learners were set to write them. The department said that two National Senior Certificate Examination Papers will be rewritten nationally following an investigation into the leaks of the Mathematics Paper 2 and Physical Sciences Paper 2. The dates of the rewrites will be as follows: Mathematics Paper 2: 15 December 2020 – 14h00
Physical Sciences Paper 2: 17 December 2020 – 09h00 “We understand that this will cause disappointment and will impact on the plans of some of our candidates, but we appeal for understanding,” the department said. “These are exceptional circumstances and are ultimately in the interest of fairness to all candidates and the credibility of these examinations. There can be no traces of doubt in the integrity of the National Senior Certificate when the results are released.” The rewrites will also impact some principals and staff who must manage the arrangements at the examination centres, as well as parents and candidates who may have to adjust holiday plans. “This examination is so important that we know they will make the necessary arrangements to accommodate this development,” the department said. Arrangements will be conveyed by the Department to examination centres and if candidates are uncertain, they should enquire from their schools nearer to the dates of the rewrite. Candidates can also contact the Safe Schools Toll Free number on 0800 45 46 47 should they wish to talk to trained professionals about their anxiety or stress.
