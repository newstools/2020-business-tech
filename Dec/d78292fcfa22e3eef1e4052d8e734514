International Relations and Cooperation minister Naledi Pandor has urged South Africans to be cautious when travelling internationally over the festive season so that they do not end up stranded while abroad. In a media briefing on Monday (14 December), Pandor said that travellers should read up thoroughly on the country they intend to visit as the global situation is ‘unstable’. She added that South African travellers will likely deal with the possibility of cancelled international flights as well as countries which introduce new restrictions at short notice. “If the country you visit is a high risk, consider postponing your visit or proceeding with caution if the travel is avoidable. Know the Covid-19 protocols of the country you intend visiting and should you not comply, you might be refused entry. “Although not common, many airlines will likely require proof of Covid-19 vaccinations before commenting travel. Currently, a Covid-19 test is compulsory.” Pandor also encouraged South Africans to sign up for travel insurance and to be aware of the contact details of South African embassies.  In a series of gazettes published on 3 December, government updated the travel rules for travellers entering and leaving the country. The biggest changes are as follows: Persons exiting the country A person exiting the country through a point of entry must be subjected to screening, including the completion of a traveller health questionnaire; A person who, during screening, is found to have had exposure to Covid-19 or is presenting with any signs and symptoms of Covid-19 must be subjected to a medical examination which may include testing; Based on the outcome of this medical examination, the director-general of Health or any delegated person may make a decision on whether or not the person is allowed to exit the country; Persons found to have contracted Covid-19 pursuant to testing, must be placed under mandatory isolation or hospitalisation; Persons placed under isolation may be permitted to self -isolate at their own private residence if they comply with the prescribed criteria.
