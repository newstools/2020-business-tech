Retail of Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles’ most powerful bakkie has now commenced. The introduction of the Amarok Double Cab bakkie with 190kW of power is a celebration of 10 years of Amarok in South Africa. The Amarok range which was launched in South Africa in 2010, has sold over 37,000 units – both single and double cab. The Amarok model range now consists of the following engines; the 2.0 BiTDI 132kW and the 3.0 V6 TDI 190kW. VW said that the most powerful Amarok distinguishes itself from the rest of the range through the new 3.0-litre V6 190kW TDI engine, which has 25kW more power as well as 30Nm more torque than the outgoing 165kW derivative. The Amarok 3.0-litre V6 TDI generates 190kW from 3,000 to 4,500 rpm and 580 Newton metres of torque from 1,400 to 2,750 rpm which is channelled through its standard eight-speed automatic gearbox. The newest edition completes the zero to 100 km/h sprint in just 7.6 seconds and has a top speed of 207 km/h. The average fuel consumption is 9.5 litres per 100 kilometres, the German carmaker said. With an over-boost function that powers the Amarok to a maximum power output of 200kW for 10 seconds, it is the most powerful bakkie on sale in South Africa at the moment. Off-road ABS and stability control enhance the Amarok’s safety features and four disc brakes all round give the Amarok V6 190kW enormous stopping power. The Amarok also has the largest bin, largest loading width and the largest cabin in its class.
