Basani Maluleke is chief executive officer at African Bank, having been appointed to the role in 2018 following more than a decade at the bank, as a non-executive. Maluleke has a B Com LLB (University of Cape Town), MBA (Kellogg) and is an admitted attorney. She has over 10 years’ financial services working experience and has also worked for Edward Nathan Friedland, FirstRand’s RMB division as well as in various FNB divisions. More recently, she was an executive director of Transcend Capital, a corporate finance business specialising in B-BBEE ownership. Her main objective since taking the lead role at African Bank has been to re-build the bank to sustainable profitability, and to maintain and improve the relationship with existing and new customers. The financial services sector has changed fundamentally in response to digital banking offerings and a growing competitive landscape. Under Maluleke’s leadership, African Bank aims to continue to evolve, transforming into a fully transnational South African bank. In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Maluleke talks through the challenges of managing a large financial organisation during an unprecedented event like the Covid-19 pandemic. She says that it has changed the way people in her company want to work. She says that coming out of the pandemic, the success of an organisation will be determined by the velocity of learning – how quickly a company can learn and adapt. Maluleke also shares with Michael some interesting findings on how customer behaviour has changed following lockdown, and as the economy begins to re-open. The full interview is embedded below.
