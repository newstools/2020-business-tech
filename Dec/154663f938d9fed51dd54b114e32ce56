Netflix has revealed its most popular content in South Africa for 2020. “This year, South Africans more than doubled the amount of their Netflix viewing compared to 2019,” the streaming service said. “At the start of the year (pre-Covid lockdowns from Jan – Feb 2020), South Africans spent most of their ‘TV Time’ watching titles across multiple genres – however, from March to July, thrillers, action, musicals and reality had a surge in viewing hours, with kids content, drama and comedy+stand up taking the top three spots of the most popular genres throughout the year.” The genres that saw the biggest boost in viewing, however, were fantasy, K-Dramas, and anime. Additionally, many sports fans turned to sports-related documentaries on Netflix during lockdown to compensate for the lack of live sports. Netflix listed the most popular shows on its platform across various genres, as well as generally popular shows. “Throughout this year there have been some titles that South Africans couldn’t get enough of,” Netflix said. “These series and films enjoyed the longest run on South Africa’s Top 10 lists after their launch on the service in 2020.” These titles range across multiple genres and include the following: Tiger King: Murder, Mayhem and Madness
Blood & Water
