Adding to South Africa’s lockdown woes, Eskom has announced that Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented on Tuesday and Wednesday. The load shedding will take place overnight, starting at 22h00 on Tuesday night, and ending at 05h00 on Wednesday. This will again be repeated on Wednesday night, the utility said. The blackouts are due to a high number of units down due to unplanned maintenance, and also so that Eskom can preserve emergency generation reserves for expected high demand in January as economic activity resumes. “During this period Eskom will continue to pursue increased reliability maintenance as planned and previously communicated,” it said. The utility said that it currently has 9,745MW on planned maintenance, with another 11,346MW unavailable due to unplanned maintenance. It said its teams were working to restore as many units as possible. The load shedding hits less than a day after president Cyril Ramaphosa pushed the country back to level 3 lockdown – prohibiting all social gatherings for 14 days, and confining people to their homes under an extended curfew. Curfew will now run from 21h00 until 06h00 each day – almost the exact same hours that load shedding will be implemented.
