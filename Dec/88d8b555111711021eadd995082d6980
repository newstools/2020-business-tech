Bank Zero is planning a gradual move from its current beta testing to a public launch with people who supplied their details on the Bank Zero website next year. This is feedback from Bank Zero founder Michael Jordaan, who was responding to questions from MyBroadband. In May Jordaan said Bank Zero planned to launch a controlled public beta early in the second half of 2020. The new digital bank published its pricing guide for individual and business customers in October, but a public launch has been pushed out to 2021. Bank Zero CEO Yatin Narsai said they will not be doing a “big bang” launch, especially this late in the year with many people already away on leave. Instead of a big launch, Bank Zero said it will learn from customer feedback and incorporate such feedback before opening the gates. Narsai said this approach will allow them to manage volumes and incorporate important customer feedback. “Our transition to public availability will be fast but controlled,” Narsai said. “The transition happens early 2021.” Bank Zero account pricing Bank Zero only offers one account type because it doesn’t believe in the practice of luring customers in with an entry-level account that has limited functionality. The same pricing structure is offered across individual and business banking. It currently supports (Pty) Ltd’s, CCs, and Sole Proprietors, with trusts and partnerships to be included at a later date. <img class="size-full wp-image-444020 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bank-Zero-fees.png" alt="" width="670" height="864" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bank-Zero-fees.png 670w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Bank-Zero-fees-233x300.png 233w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> This article first appeared on MyBroadband.
