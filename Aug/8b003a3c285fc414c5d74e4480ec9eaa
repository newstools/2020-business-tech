One of South Africa’s most prominent homes, the ‘Vaal Castle’, has been put up for sale by Absa and High Street Auctions. The Financial Mail reports that the home is the largest in South Africa, at more than 6,000m², and belongs to former Absa executive Kennedy Bungane It has been up for a private treaty sale which means the deal is confidentially negotiated between seller and buyer and is not auctioned. The Vaal Castle is situated in the exclusive Klipplaatdrift River Estate to the south of Three Rivers and bordered by the Suikerbosrand River and the Vaal River to the north and west respectively. “Within the past seven years an entrance gate had been built to the north of the Suikerbosrand River and a steel bridge with a guard hut added to give more convenient access to Vereeniging, reducing approximately 5 km off a trip,” High Street Auctions said. “The dirt roads were also tarred in the not too distant past.” <img class="size-full wp-image-429482 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location.png" alt="" width="789" height="519" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location.png 789w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location-300x197.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location-768x505.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-429484 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location-2.png" alt="" width="782" height="497" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location-2.png 782w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location-2-300x191.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Location-2-768x488.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> The total size of the property stands at 9.4 hectares of land with river frontage, while the house itself is 6,240m².
