Sasol Ltd said it will swing to a full-year loss per share after writedowns on US chemical assets contributed to R112 billion ($6.3 billion) of charges and oil prices declined. The South African fuel and chemical maker’s results for the year ended June 30 were “impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic and a severe decline in crude oil and chemical product prices,” Sasol said in a trading statement. Lower demand for fuel due to the coronavirus pandemic, along with a battering for oil prices, weighed on a company already reeling from mismanagement and cost overruns at the Lake Charles Chemicals Project in Louisiana. Sasol has accelerated an asset disposal program aimed at reducing debt and avoiding a last-resort rights offer.
