Absa has revised its forecast for GDP contraction in South Africa in 2020, to 8.3% from 9.7% previously, reflecting the better than expected data from the first, and second quarter. But the financial services firm warned that the economic recovery in H2 2020 is likely to be slower than previously expected amid extended lockdown measures, and more localised disruptions to activity from ongoing Covid-19 outbreaks. It also cited “a large negative demand shock from job losses, and the expiration of some of the government’s economic relief initiatives” for its “partial recovery of 2.4%” in 2021. South Africa’s already strained public finances will remain under immense pressure, the macro economic research team at Absa said in a research document entitled ‘Q3 2020 Quarterly Perspectives’. In the Supplementary Budget presented in June, the National Treasury projected a main budget deficit of 14.6% of GDP (equivalent to a primary deficit of 9.7% of GDP) for FY2020/21. “We believe the outcome is likely to be worse and project a main budget deficit of 16.6% of GDP,” said Absa. Finance minister Mboweni has signalled a plan to achieve a primary balance in FY2023/24, which will require expenditure cuts worth R230 billion in the next two fiscal years, over and above the planned R160 billion wage bill cuts. “We are doubtful that cuts of this magnitude can be achieved,” Absa said. It said that given the inherent uncertainty and the magnitude of the policy challenges created by the crisis, other outcomes for the economy, relative to its baseline forecast, are possible, either for better or for worse. “If the pandemic comes under control sooner than we expect, the recovery in 2021 may be stronger.” Moreover, with reforms to lower the cost of doing business and lift confidence, we believe that the medium-term growth potential can be lifted to about 2.5%, Absa said. “However, there is an alternative scenario in which the pandemic, along with its costs, drag South Africa’s macroeconomic performance down to a much weaker level,” it said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-423572" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Absa.png" alt="" width="882" height="174" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Absa.png 882w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Absa-300x59.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Absa-768x152.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> For better or for worse Absa discusses two possible alternative scenarios to its baseline, under the title ‘better or worse’. For better to be South Africa’s future, Absa said it needs to see some reasonably robust combination of the following things happen: “If a strong majority of these things were to happen, we believe South Africa could reasonably expect a much stronger GDP bounce in 2021 than our forecast of just +2.4% and medium term growth rates to rise back to around 2.5% or so.” However, South Africa’s future could also be worse, if some collection of the following developments were to materialise in force: “Obviously, even some of these risk scenarios could drive South Africa to a rather dark place economically, under which GDP growth would further stagnate. The SARB would likely keep rates lower for longer, but at some point, the rand would likely weaken a lot and the SARB would then have to hike rates sharply. “The building debt crisis would come to a boil, possibly leading the government to try to introduce asset prescription in an effort to avoid a full-fledged IMF programme with strict conditionality, for which there is no political support,” Absa said.
