Ford has launched its new limited-edition Ranger Thunder, promising a wider range of features and options over the standard Ranger model. As with the Wildtrak and Ranger Raptor, the Thunder is powered by the 2.0-litre Bi-Turbo engine – producing 157kW and 500Nm, and is mated to a 10-speed automatic transmission. Ford has also introduced a number of physical changes with the Ranger Thunder’s design. These include a revised honeycomb-style front grille, black detailing, and 18-inch multi-spoke alloy wheels. Aside from the visual enhancements, the Ranger Thunder includes a number of practical additions including a lockable ‘Mountain Top’ black roller shutter to safely secure goods being carried. Ford said that the Ranger Thunder will also include a cargo area management system with a bed divider that allows the owner to easily compartmentalise the available space for securely holding different-sized items. <img class="size-full wp-image-425194 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ford-ranger-thunder-e1597324410259.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-425202 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ford-ranger-thunder-1-e1597324481106.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-425204 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/ford-ranger-thunder-2-e1597324496513.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="801" /> Safety The Ranger Thunder has  Autonomous Emergency Braking (AEB) which uses a combination of radar and camera systems along with new software to detect pedestrians, as well as stationary and moving objects.
