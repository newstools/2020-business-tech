Pick n Pay Clothing has launched an online shop, allowing customers to view the store’s full clothing range with deliveries available nationwide. The group said that while PnP Clothing will have a dedicated website , customers with an existing PnP Online profile can use their details to log onto the new facility. Customers will also earn Smart Shopper points on their PnP Clothing purchases. Delivery is available anywhere within South Africa, at a set rate of R60, and orders are expected to be delivered within three to five working days. “The new website launches with PnP Clothing’s Summer range that is now available in stores. More styles will be added in the coming weeks to host the full assortment that customers can expect to find in a large store,” the group said. The website will have an easy-to-use online sizing guide for items, but customers will be able to return or exchange an item for free at their closest Pick n Pay Clothing, supermarket or hypermarket, except for underwear. General manager for Pick n Pay Clothing, Hazel Pillay, said that the group is already working on introducing new ranges and features. This will include the launch of a Click n Collect service at a later date, she said. Read: Shoprite sees boost in sales and earnings despite lockdown and alcohol sales ban
