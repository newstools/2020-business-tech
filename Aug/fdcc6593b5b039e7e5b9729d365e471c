Power utility Eskom says that it will implement stage 2 load shedding on Thursday (13 August) as it battles with continued unit breakdowns. The utility said that the load shedding will start at 08h00 and is set to continue until 22h00. Eskom said that the load shedding has been caused by an increase in plant breakdowns during the night and early hours of the morning. “The delay of the return to service of two units at Duvha and Tutuka and the breakdowns of four units at Kriel, Tutuka and Kendal have resulted in the need for load shedding today. “These units removed more than 2,000 MW of capacity from the system. Eskom is working hard to return as many of these generation units to service.” “The generating plant continues to perform at low levels of reliability, any unexpected shift such as an increase in unplanned breakdowns could result in a change in the load shedding stage at short notice.” Eskom warned that there is also a high possibility that stage 2 load shedding may be escalated to stage 3 during evening peak.
