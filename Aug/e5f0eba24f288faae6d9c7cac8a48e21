The Department of Basic Education has published the new calendar for the rest of the 2020 school year, which has been structured so that the academic year won’t push into 2021. This follows a decision by government to shut schools for a period of 4 weeks, set to re-open on 24 August. In terms of the new calendar, there are now 163 actual school days for teachers, and 156 for learners. The department said that the school year will complete on 15 December 2020 for grades R to 11, and will not be carried over into 2021. A break will be required to separate the third and fourth terms, so a small holiday will take place between 26 and 30 October. These are the remaining terms: Term 3: 24 August – 23 October
Term 4: 2 November – 15 December Matric exams will also be concluded by 15 December, the department said, with marking expected to be done by 22 January 2021, and the results released on 23 February 2021. The 2021 school year will start on 25 January for teachers, and few days later for learners.
