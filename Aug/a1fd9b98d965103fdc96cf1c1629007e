Power utility Eskom says that it will continue stage 2 load shedding on Friday (14 August) as it faces continued capacity constraints. This follows the introduction of stage 2 load shedding on Thursday due to unplanned breakdowns. “Eskom has successfully returned four generation units to service today. This, however, is not sufficient to stave off load shedding at this point. “Eskom will, therefore, continue to implement stage 2 load shedding until 22h00 tonight. Stage 2 load shedding will resume again at 08h00 until 22h00 tomorrow.” The power provider said that the load shedding has been caused by an increase in plant breakdowns over the last few days. It indicated that staying on stage 2 load shedding will assist in preserving emergency generation reserves, namely diesel and water. “Breakdowns this week have remover more than 13,000 MW of capacity from the system, while planned maintenance stands at 5,000 MW of infrastructure,” it said.
