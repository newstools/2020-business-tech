The South African Graduate Employers Association (SAGEA) has published its list of the leading graduate employers for 2020. Launched in 2010, the survey is conducted on an annual basis to help SAGEA members to review the success of their graduate campaigns and help plan their future recruitment programmes. The research took place from March to May 2020, using an online questionnaire and 2,739 candidates responded during this time. “Each survey participant was asked to name up to two organisations whom they felt had the best graduate programme in specific sectors or industry groups with which they were familiar,” the SAGEA said. There were no lists of organisations to choose from and their responses were entirely unprompted, it said. The association said that candidates were most likely to vote for specific organisations based on the programmes available, the training & development, the overall reputation of the organisation or the appeal of the brand, product or services. Sector winners In the accountancy sector, PwC gained more than a quarter of the votes, while ‘the Big Four’ professional services firms gained more than three-quarters of the votes within the accountancy sector. There was a large number of votes in commercial and retail banking, with Standard Bank receiving just under a quarter of the votes, SAGEA said. Sasol gained the most votes in both the chemical & pharmaceutical and engineering or industrial sectors. Three organisations were the top employers in their sector for the first time this year: Amazon within IT software and hardware; Mercedes-Benz in the automotive sector; and Tiger Brands for manufacturing. Below are the companies South African students chose as the best across every major category. <img class="size-full wp-image-420792 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SAGEA.jpg" alt="" width="800" height="1228" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SAGEA.jpg 800w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SAGEA-195x300.jpg 195w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SAGEA-667x1024.jpg 667w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/SAGEA-768x1179.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: The JSE introduces new gender-neutral parental leave policy
