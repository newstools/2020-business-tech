Tracker has published its vehicle crime statistics for 2020, with the group’s data showing that hijacking is on the rise and remained prevalent during the lockdown period even with a significant drop in vehicle crime. The data, which considered cases from July 2019 to June 2020, is based on Tracker’s more than 1.1 million installed vehicle base. The statistics reveal that before lockdown, the number of vehicle crime activities rose nationally by 11% year-on-year, driven mainly by hijacking – up 21%. Theft of vehicles, meanwhile, remained at a similar level to the previous year, the vehicle tracking group said. The lockdown Tracker said that the lockdown period brought with it an extraordinary set of circumstances and vehicle crime numbers last seen decades ago, particularly during level 5 restrictions. In April, the number of vehicle crime activities nationally declined to only 19% of the average monthly vehicle crime activities. As the country’s restrictions were lifted vehicle crime activities increased, with May experiencing a three-fold increase to 62% of the average vehicle crime activities, while June was close to usual levels at 93%. However, even with this drastic decrease in vehicle crime, hijacking was more prevalent than theft during lockdown, Tracker said. Hijacking attributed a higher percentage of the Tracker vehicle crime activities during lockdown when compared to theft, averaging a 56/44 split. This is an increase on the 50/50 split between hijacking and theft for the months before lockdown, the group said. In addition, despite level 3 lockdown June 2020 hijacking numbers reached the same level as June 2019. Trends The latest data also indicates that there has been a shift in the trend regarding day of week and time of day when hijacking is reported. Hijacking is now prevalent throughout the week, from Tuesday to Saturday, with only slightly less activity on Sundays and Mondays. Hijackings are also reported to Tracker throughout the day from 11h00 to midnight. Meanwhile theft is mainly reported around the weekend, and during lunchtime hours. “Hostage-taking is still a daily occurrence and remains a huge concern. Further crime trends noted by Tracker include a noticeable increase in vehicles being targeted for their loads, particularly food items and fast-moving consumable goods. “Clients are also being robbed of their valuables and in some instance’s large amounts of cash,” it said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-423202" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tracker-Vehicle-Crime-Index-July-2019-June-2020.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="3145" />  Areas The provinces and towns most affected by vehicle crime remain similar to past indices.
