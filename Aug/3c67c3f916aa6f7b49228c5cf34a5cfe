Private medical group Netcare has launched its new NetcarePlus GP Vouchers, aimed at improving access to consultations with general practitioners (GPs) in private practices. The NetcarePlus GP Voucher product offers a choice between three types of pre-paid vouchers that are redeemable for a consultation with a GP, said NetcarePlus managing director, Teshlin Akaloo. Akaloo said that individuals can choose to buy a voucher that gives them access to an in-person consultation, a voucher that covers the consultation and prescribed acute medications such as antibiotics, or one that provides access to a virtual doctor consultation. “The competitive pricing of the NetcarePlus GP Vouchers, which is offered at a discount in relation to medical aid tariffs, compares very favourably with private GP consultation fees across the industry, and provides excellent value for money,” he said. A NetcarePlus GP Voucher for a virtual doctor consultation costs R290. A voucher for an in-person doctor consultation costs R350, while a voucher for an in-person doctor consultation including the cost of certain acute medicines costs R430. Over 500 doctors across all nine provinces are already part of the partner network, Akaloo said. “Our partner GPs are located in the major centres across the country, but with a virtual option as part of the NetcarePlus GP Vouchers, anyone can now access private GP consultations regardless of where they live or work.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-425084" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Netcare.png" alt="" width="900" height="605" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Netcare.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Netcare-300x202.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> How to purchase and use NetcarePlus GP Vouchers An individual can select from the three types of NetcarePlus GP Vouchers and can purchase as many vouchers as they wish through a secure platform.
