Sponsored Articles are the most trusted form of online advertising in South Africa, and are an excellent way to reach both businesses and consumers. As detailed in the 2020 South African Business Marketing Report, online articles are more trusted than Google Adverts; Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn posts; videos; and influencer posts. It is for this reason that BusinessTech developed the Sponsored Article marketing product – which delivers an advertising message in a trusted format. “If you want to build trust among your audience, then you must share your message with them in a way that inspires trust,” said BusinessTech MD Kevin Lancaster. <img class="size-full wp-image-413731 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles.jpg" alt="Articles" width="640" height="430" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles.jpg 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Articles-300x202.jpg 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Sponsored Articles are not only a powerful way to reach your audience, they are easy to create and publish. “Many companies think content is hard to create. It’s not,” said Lancaster. “We can repurpose existing press releases and company blog posts, or write a new article for you. Content is what we specialise in as an online publisher.” To see the Sponsored Articles published on BusinessTech, visit the Industry News section.
