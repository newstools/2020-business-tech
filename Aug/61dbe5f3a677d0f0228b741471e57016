Online advertising is the best way to promote your business in South Africa. This is according to Nielsen’s Media ROI Benchmarks report for South Africa, which revealed that online advertising beats TV, radio, print, and billboards to provide the best return on investment. Of the online advertising options available to companies, one stands above the rest: Sponsored Articles. Sponsored articles are the most trusted form of online advertising in South Africa, and are a great way to promote your brand, product, or service. In fact, business decision makers trust sponsored articles more than company blog posts, social media posts, Google Search adverts, videos, and influencer posts. BusinessTech is an excellent platform to promote your business using sponsored articles. As the largest business news website in South Africa, BusinessTech is read by managers, executives, directors, CEOs, CFOs, CTOs, and business owners every month. This makes it the perfect place for B2B marketing.
