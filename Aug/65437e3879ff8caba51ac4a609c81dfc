Yo keep the remaining restrictions in place and to maintain some of the essential elements of the health response, the president extended the national state of disaster until 15 September 2020. “With this new phase of our response, we need to put in place the practices and forms of behaviour that we must continue to adopt for some time to come. “This virus will remain with us for many months and I must applaud the many South Africans who have changed their way of life to meet that reality,” said the president. With the potential of a second wave still on the cards, president Ramaphosa urged citizens to maintain the hygiene protocols of washing and sanitising of hands, observing social distancing and wearing masks. “Familiarity with each other should not allow us to forget these precautions,” he said.
