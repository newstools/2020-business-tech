The City of Cape Town has published a revised parking policy for public comment, including changes around on-street parking, bicycles and e-hailing services. The current parking policy was approved in 2014, and required a revision to provide for new services, and advances in technology, the city said. “There is a need to improve enforcement of parking transgressions; to cater for new transport modes such as e-hailing and electric vehicles, and to promote parking that is friendly to the environment in terms of design and management, said the city’s mayoral committee member for Transport Felicity Purchase. “We also want to, in future, implement cashless payments for parking. The revised policy addresses these needs.” Some of the most notable proposals include: Easier access to on-street parking within central business districts for those who want to park for a short period; Easier access to designated on-street parking for people with special needs, such as those in wheelchairs; Investigate a possible discount for those who park for less than 10 or 15 minutes; Easier access to designated on-street parking bays for delivery vehicles; To encourage economic activity in central business areas by providing easy access to on-street parking bays for customers and delivery vehicles; To encourage short-stay parking within the core of the CBD and longer stay parking on the periphery of the CBD during business hours; Payment through a cashless system by using smart cards or mobile phones to improve convenience and accounting; For minor parking transgressions to be administered by the contractor who will be contracted to manage on-street parking bays on behalf of the City; To develop a rationale for the expansion or removal of managed on-street parking as and when needed. The policy also proposes new guidelines for parking tariffs: It makes provision for different parking zones to be demarcated, and for parking tariffs to differ accordingly; Different tariffs should apply for different times of day (morning, afternoon, evening), and over weekends and on public holidays; Given that motorbikes require less parking space the tariff for using a formal motorcycle bay should be lower. <img class="size-full wp-image-424326 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pricing.png" alt="" width="658" height="414" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pricing.png 658w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Pricing-300x189.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" />“We currently do not have convenient drop-and-go bays in business areas or at private developments for lift clubs, e-hailing cars, or e-hailing delivery motorbikes,” said Purchase. “Also, there must be parking incentives for more sustainable modes of transport such as bicycles, and motorbikes. New generation mobility such as electric vehicles must also be accommodated in future.” Purchase added that the draft policy requires the City to investigate the use of technology to record violations and issue penalties. “This is very important as we find that private vehicle owners often park in bays designated for loading vehicles and people with special needs, or that they do not adhere to time limits, or refuse to pay for parking,” she said.
