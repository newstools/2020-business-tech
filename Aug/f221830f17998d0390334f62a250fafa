Eskom has announced that stage 2 load shedding will continue on Thursday (20 August), as its system remains severely constrained. Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 09h00 until 22h00, it said. “While Eskom teams have today and yesterday successfully returned three generation units to service, a further three units tripped, two of which have returned,” it said. Three generators were returned to serviceat the Duvha, Tutuka and Hendrina power stations. A single generation unit at Tutuka has not yet returned to service. Unplanned breakdowns currently stand at 12,100MW, adding to 4,350MW offline for planned maintenance. Eskom warned that further breakdowns could push the load shedding stage up to higher levels at short notice. Load shedding is expected to continue for the rest of the week, with additional demand in the grid due to the cold front hitting the country.
