The Western Cape reports a notable decrease in active Covid-19 cases, as well as a decline in the number of patients requiring hospitalisation, along with a decrease in the death rate. The province also said that it now has fewer than 10,000 active coronavirus cases. The decline in these critical numbers can be attributed to every individual who has taken personal responsibility to help flatten the curve, said provincial health spokesperson Wendy Philander. “Yesterday the Western Cape Government announced that the province still has under 100,000 confirmed cases of Covid-19 and recorded 83,529 recoveries. “And, due to extensive planning based on worst-case scenarios, we have not seen the need for full use of all available resources such as beds at field hospitals,” she said. Citing data from from the National Institute For Communicable Diseases, Philander said that since mid-June to the 1 August the Western Cape has seen a steady decrease in both accounted and unaccounted deaths. “Unlike other provinces, we are also witnessing a welcoming decrease in infections amongst healthcare workers in the Western Cape. “The provincial government, along with overseeing sufficient and appropriate provision of Personal Protective Equipment, has provided psycho-social support to workers to continually support the healthcare system as a whole.” “Overall, we see that the curve is indeed flattening in our province and that the provincial government’s hotspot strategy, incorporating the whole of government approach, is a model that works based on international best practice.” Although these are encouraging signs, citizens still need to direct every effort to keep safe, Philander said. “The use of masks, social distancing protocols, and good personal hygiene remains imperative as select areas still need to overcome their peak. We also cannot rule out the possibility of second-waves, as we witness them in various parts of the world.”  As of 5 August, the Western Cape has 9,652 active cases of Covid-19, with a total of 96,446 confirmed cases and 83,529 recoveries. The City of Cape Town has reported the majority of the province’s cases at 66,828 cases and 59,080 recoveries. Looking at a district level, Tygerberg has the most cases (11,888) followed by the Eastern suburbs (8,845). The Western Cape said it has been working closely with the NICD, using sophisticated, integrated systems to cross-reference excess reported deaths to determine if they are Covid-19 related in order to ensure that our records are as accurate as possible. As a result, the province reported 93 additional deaths on Wednesday – with the majority of these being historical deaths which have now been correctly allocated as Covid-19 deaths. These deaths did not occur in hospitals, and as such, the province’s Department of Health may not have picked up a Covid-19 positive result. These deaths were recorded as follows: 4 deaths in May;
33 deaths in June;
16 deaths in July;
8 deaths in August.

Mkhize presented data in a virtual briefing on Wednesday (5 August) showing that the Western Cape, Eastern Cape and Gauteng have all seen a decline in reported cases over the last three weeks. “The question that has been raised is whether the plateau that is observed in some provinces is due to reduced testing numbers or if indeed less people are becoming infected with coronavirus,” he said. “Whilst we are cautiously optimistic, it is still too early for us to make definite conclusions regarding the observed decline,” Mkhize said. “We need to continue to track all these indicators and ensure that our testing capacity reflects a realist picture of our epidemiological status. We will therefore only know for sure when there is a consistent decline over a period. “It is worth mentioning that, as part of improving the records of Covid-19 related deaths in response to reports on excess deaths, we now require that all the sudden deaths and those that occur at home must have specimens taken for Covid-19 before a death certificate is issued.” Read: South Africa’s cigarette sales ban decision is wrong on two fronts: court case
