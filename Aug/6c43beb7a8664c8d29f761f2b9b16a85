Uber has announced the launch of its new Uber Connect service in South Africa, allowing customers to send packages to one another through the app. The service will allow users to send items to each other by requesting “Uber Connect” through the Uber app, said Frans Hiemstra, general manager for Sub-Saharan Africa. Safety remains a top priority and Uber Connect follows all relevant hygiene and safety protocols, he said These include the requirement of masks for all drivers, as well as the completion of a safety checklist which reminds drivers to wash their hands and sanitise their relevant delivery bags. Senders and recipients will also need to follow a checklist to ensure social distancing measures are followed, he said. How it works Package the items in a sealed box or bag, wiping down surfaces with disinfectant; Type in the destination in your Uber app; Choose Uber Connect as the vehicle option (you may have to swipe up for the option); Follow the notifications: You’ll get notifications providing instructions on how to help ensure a smooth pickup and when your delivery-partner is arriving, just as you would with an UberX trip; As you see the motorbike approach in the app, you should head outside and load your item into the topbox; Share the trip with your recipient so that they can track the trip and meet the delivery partner outside to retrieve the package from the delivery partner; This service is limited to areas where Uber Eats operates. Uber said that packages sent using Uber Connect must total less than the equivalent of R1,500 in value per trip, be less than 15 kilograms, and fit comfortably in the top box of a motorbike. Prohibited items include but are not limited to: medication, recreational drugs, and dangerous or illegal items. Uber said it does not maintain insurance coverage for package loss, damage, or theft.
