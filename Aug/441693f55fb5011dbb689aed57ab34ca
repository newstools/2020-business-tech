Virtual servers have become increasingly popular for small and medium-sized businesses due to the benefits they provide. These include reduced costs, improved reliability, and better business continuity. However, many businesses do not understand what a virtual server is and why they should consider implementing them into their IT solution. Network Platforms has published a whitepaper which provides information about the different types of server solutions to simplify the topic for businesses. Click here to download the full whitepaper – “Virtual Servers for your business – A guide for the non-technical” A virtual server is a server solution that is driven by software to make the best use of the hardware upon which it operates. Each virtual server has its own operating system and software, but multiple iterations can run on a single physical server machine. Functionally, the same solutions and tasks can be run on a virtual server as can be run on a dedicated physical server – but a virtual server allows for the more efficient use of each physical server machine by sharing its resources between multiple virtual server instances. For example, if a business needs more resources, they will not need to purchase more hardware to support this – as would be the case with an on-site server solution. Instead, a cloud server provider can simply allocate the business’s virtual server more resources. The inverse is also true – if a business does not need as many resources as they are currently allocated, the server provider can scale their resources down and save the business money. In contrast, a traditional physical server solution will waste resources whenever it is not using the full capacity of the server hardware – and businesses will have to purchase more hardware when more capacity is required. There are several things that you should consider when choosing a virtual server provider for your business. Firstly, it is crucial that the provider is partnered with leading software companies. The provider should also have the appropriate accreditations and experience, and its staff should have good credentials. You also should ensure that the provider’s data centres are set up at different sites and have all the necessary features to ensure reliability and redundancy is up to scratch. You should then analyse the product they are offering to ensure it is sufficient for your needs. This includes: Processing capacity
Technologies used
Customer support levels
Security measures
Data policies
Customisation options
Value adds It is also worth looking at trial options – not only because it will let you test the service, but it is also a sign that the provider is confident about their product. When buying virtual servers, you will need to determine how much you must pay to get the right servers for your business. Virtual servers can range from hundreds to thousands of rand per month. Key specifications that are worth looking at to determine which solution is right for you include storage space, storage device type, CPU cores, memory, private nodes, and the speed of uplink. If you are uncertain which packages suit your business best, it is worth discussing the situation with a knowledgeable IT professional. Networks Platforms’ whitepaper expands upon the information above by providing clear and extensive instructions that are easy to understand – even if you’re not a technology-minded person.
