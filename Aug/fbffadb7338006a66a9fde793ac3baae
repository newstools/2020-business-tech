US coffee chain Starbucks says it will embark on a ‘bold expansion’ into Cape Town, scheduled for later this year. “We remain committed to our expansion strategy and vision, which is to provide all South Africans with an extraordinary experience and offering, from both a customer and partner perspective, despite the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Adrian Maizey, owner and CEO of Rand Capital Coffee, the custodian of Starbucks in Southern Africa. Maizey said that Starbucks’ launch into Cape Town was initially intended to happen in June. “When Covid-19 hit we had to place the initiative on hold, triggering several hard decisions that impacted all partners, and a mass round of lease renegotiations across the country. “Fortunately, we have resilient partners and we are grateful to those landlords who share our vision and commitment to contribute to the South African economy, and who have worked closely with us to help ensure our expansion was only delayed and not cancelled. “It is during such a time of crisis that the importance of collaboration between all stakeholders for the greater good, is most apparent,” said Maizey. With several leases now in place in the Mother City, and investment initiated in the requisite supply chain, which the company has now brought in-house, Starbucks Southern Africa is now embarking on building its Cape Town team. Rand Capital Coffee’s expansion journey will initially result in at least 50 permanent new jobs, with the further employment of local artists, construction contractors, and artisans, it said. Maizey said the Cape Town stores “will offer an experience consistent with the values and store atmosphere that Starbucks is known for globally, designed to reflect the most beautiful city of them all”. Starbucks is currently located in various locations in Pretoria, Johannesburg, and in Durban, with 16 stores currently open in the country.
