It is critical that you remain connected and have efficient business communication technologies available to you during the COVID-19 pandemic. This is because business meetings and communications have moved online – and this trend is likely to continue even after the pandemic is over. Learn more about the Huawei IdeaHub series The Huawei IdeaHub is the ultimate solution to your work-from-home and video conferencing needs, as it offers a multi-faceted communications platform which uses advanced technologies and hardware to facilitate meetings, provide a digital whiteboard, and much more. Huawei solution architect Kamau Maina explained that the IdeaHub was premised upon Huawei’s 1 + 3 + X approach: 1 – Operate on a single platform, be it on-premise or the cloud. 3 – That platform should work with three important device types: Traditional media conferencing systems, IdeaHub product lines, and desktop/personal devices. X – Users should have access to an almost unlimited number of applications Maina highlighted that Huawei’s new AppGallery will also allow users of the IdeaHub to access an extensive range of apps – including popular communications applications such as Microsoft Teams and Zoom. The IdeaHub is the ultimate device to facilitate communications both internally and with your customers in the most comprehensive and intuitive way. The primary value of the device is how well it enables advanced video conferencing, offering up to 4K conferencing and video projection. Additionally, the physical device functions as an interactive whiteboard, which allows the user to write on it digitally with a latency of just 35ms. The device uses intelligent handwriting recognition to convert your writing to digital text, too, making it easier for those involved in the call to process and use data as you share your display with them. Alongside this feature, IdeaHub devices can record your video conferences and automatically annotate both your words and those of the call’s other participants. The IdeaHub has almost endless use cases as it offers tremendous value across any industry. These devices can function as powerful teaching tools for educators – particularly for those who conduct distance learning – or allow finance industry employees to easily share, discuss, and amend financial documents and policies. In terms of the health industry, doctors can use these devices to collaborate and share their knowledge of various diseases and cases – which is particularly valuable now given the COVID-19 pandemic. The IdeaHub range also offers fantastic value for those working from home, as it allows them to set up a single device and use it for an extensive range of communications tasks. Home office owners and users can rest assured that setting up their IdeaHub is not challenging and does not require the assistance of an IT specialist.
