The Office of the Chief Procurement Officer (OCPO) has published a full list of all companies who have been awarded contracts by the government for the supply of goods and services relating to the Covid-19 pandemic. The lists include Covid-19 procurement information from all provinces, national departments and over 70 public entities. The move is in line with a directive issued by President Ramaphosa on 5 August 2020 for departments to submit full information on Covid-19 tenders to the ministerial team convened by Justice and Correctional Services Minister Ronald Lamola. Ramaphosa said the publication of these online lists are ‘historic’ and highlight government’s increased drive to tackle corruption. “This measure is unprecedented, and a clear demonstration of government’s commitment to transparency and accountability when it comes to allegations of corruption in the Covid-19 procurement process,” he said. “The collaboration and cooperation between government departments during this process has been laudable, and a clear indication that we are going to intensify our efforts to act against any individuals or companies involved in corruption and profiteering around this pandemic.” The National Treasury said it will regularly update the online register to ensure information remains current. “By publishing these lists we have honoured our promise to the South African people. They enable proper scrutiny of the details of all companies who have received tenders for Covid-19 related services,” said Ramaphosa.
