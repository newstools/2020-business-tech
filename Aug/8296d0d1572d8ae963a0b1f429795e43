Amdec Group, developer of the R15 billion mixed-use Harbour Arch precinct planned for Cape Town, has confirmed it has received full approval from the city to move ahead with the development. The project was first approved by the City in October 2019, after which it faced several appeals, halting the process. While rezoning for the new project was approved as far back as 2012, the development has faced a number of hurdles – including objections from affordable housing activists. The activists argued that there was a lack of affordable housing included in the development, which they believed would further exclude poor and working-class people from the city centre. They called on the City to reject the application until it included the provision of affordable housing either within the development itself or surrounding area. Amdec has now confirmed that the City has given the project the green light, with main contractor moving onto site on 1 September. Bulk earthworks have been in progress since the start of 2020, with the current anticipated completion date for Harbour Arch tower one in first quarter 2023. The Cape Argus reported that the City of Cape Town’s planning committee held two meetings over the last month where the plans were again tabled, and the appeals dismissed, allowing the project to go now ahead. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-426962" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Harbour-arch-2020-02-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The development will be built on a 5.8-hectare site, with 198,000 square metres of usable space, featuring six individual towers. The site will also be home to two new hotels, to be operated by Marriott International, long-standing partners of the Amdec Group and the world’s largest hospitality group. Included in the plans are 100 units of ‘inclusionary’ housing, the Argus reported. Amdec said that the development represents a massive private sector investment into the city, and is estimated to create at least 20,000 construction jobs. In addition to new job opportunities, the project will also boost investor confidence both locally and abroad and bolster the city’s economy, the group said.
