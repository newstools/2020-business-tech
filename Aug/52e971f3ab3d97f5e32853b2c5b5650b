Looking holistically at the various industries and sectors in South Africa, it can be noted that there are numerous accidents in which employees are injured, often critical, and although there are unforeseen circumstances, there are exceptions where it could be avoided. Especially where the provision of effective training plays a key factor in ensuring that employees are skilled to perform certain tasks along with ensuring Health and Safety compliance throughout an organisation and active managing of risks. The prevention of Health and Safety related incidents and ensuring that employees are provided with a safe and healthy environment is the first step as it is vital for the success of a business, as employees are the most valuable asset of any organisation. When organisations provide effective Health and Safety information and training it helps an organisation to: Prevent injuries and illness which may arise from the tasks that employees perform.
Develop a Health and Safety culture which allows safe and healthy work practices become second nature and which can be extended to outside the workplace.
Identify how Health and Safety can be managed more effectively.
Fulfil the legal duty imposed on the organisation pertaining to the protection of the Health and Safety of employees. The main purpose behind training and the provision thereof is to teach employees how a certain task must be done. It also serves to tell employees how a task should not be done, and to provide employees with information pertaining to their tasks. Training goes further than the classroom courses and certificates, it often provides insights that go beyond the workplace, and relevance pertaining to everyday life in ensuring Health and Safety. Despite the industry and organisation, there are concerns with levels of competence and the high expectation pertaining to newly-trained or qualified employees. Individuals are more employable and valued based on their experience which they gain from on-the-job training and consolidation along with non-formal training in the form of Continuous Professional Development, otherwise known as CPD. CPD is the term used in the description of learning activities that professionals engage in to develop as well as enhance their abilities. CPD enables learning to become both conscious and proactive instead of passive and reactive. When considering that training may often be reactive and a tedious task where there is little innovation, it greatly affects the effectiveness of training and subsequently the Health and Safety compliance in the workplace. Without CPD, knowledge which is gained through innovation and work experience will be unable to spread throughout the organisation and the industry. CPD is vital to employees, the organisation, and the client and by managing it effectively, there are numerous benefits that can be reaped along with increasing profitability and competitiveness. The motivation of employees plays a crucial role and it affects loyalty and committed towards the organisation and in turn, CPD allows organisations to attract, recruit, and retain skilled employees. Effective Health and Safety training provides organisations with the following benefits: It contributes towards ensuring that employees are competent in both Health and Safety whether it is task-specific or general Health and Safety.
It can help the organisation avoid the distress associated with accidents and illness causes.
