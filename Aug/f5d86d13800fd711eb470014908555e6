Eskom says it will implement Stage 2 load shedding from 16h00 until 22h00 as its power system is severely constrained. The power utility said that Stage 2 will also again be implemented from 09h00 until 22h00 on Wednesday (19 August). The group has been hit by generating unit trips over the last few days, where at one stage eight units were offline simultaneously. Six units have since been returned to service, it said, but four units then broke down overnight, and in the early hours of Tuesday morning. There has also been a delay in returning other units to power, it said.
