BusinessTech has seen a big increase in the number of companies advertising with it. As South Africa’s largest business news website, BusinessTech is read by CEOs, CIOs, CTOs, directors, business owners, managers, and working professionals every day. The majority of BusinessTech’s readers are also the decision makers in their home. This makes BusinessTech a highly-valuable platform for companies to reach customers in both the business and consumer markets. BusinessTech’s valuable audience is only one of the factors which has driven more companies to advertise on the site. As more companies take a digital-first approach to advertising, online channels such as BusinessTech are in high demand. This is because online advertising provides companies with the best return on their investment – outperforming TV, radio, print, and billboards. With maximum value and exposure the name of the game as businesses navigate the coronavirus pandemic and subsequent lockdowns, this makes BusinessTech a destination of choice for advertising budgets. BusinessTech offers a range of advertising options, including sponsored articles, social media promotions, display banners, homepage takeovers, and more.
