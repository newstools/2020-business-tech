The South African government has received more unsolicited interests from private sector funders, investors and partners for a future restructured South African Airways (SAA) and its subsidiaries. The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) said that as of the end of August it had received more than 10 unsolicited interests for SAA and its subsidiaries Air Chefs, South African Airways Technical and Mango Airlines. “As the sole shareholder on behalf of government, the DPE had been busy assessing the interests from the several unsolicited local and international Strategic Equity Partners (SEPs) as part of the implementation of the Business Rescue Plan, which was published at the end of June 2020,” it said. The DPE said that such investments in the airline and its subsidiaries will help support key economic sectors, including tourism and solidify South Africa as an African gateway to international markets. “Such partnerships will also improve scale and scope and ensure continuity of value creation to the South African economy and long-term sustainability of the aviation industry managed by competent, competitive and skilled personnel who possess strategic and technical capabilities, which are critical to the success of the new carrier.” In addition to maintaining a certain level of presence in the ownership of the new carrier, government said it would like to see a number of characteristics in the new airline.
