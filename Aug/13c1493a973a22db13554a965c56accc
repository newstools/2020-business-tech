The Department of Tourism has published a new draft recovery plan, outlining the country’s response to the coronavirus pandemic and how the tourism industry is likely to be impacted over the coming year. The document is a detailed breakdown of international and local projections for when tourism will likely open up, using modelling that takes into account various infection patterns and recovery scenarios. South Africa’s projections are predicated on international trends, which modelling shows is likely to open up for travel in a wide window of between August 2020 and May 2021. Depending on the local spread of Covid-19 and recovery scenarios, South Africa’s tourism could start opening up as early as August 2020 in the best-case scenario, the department said – but in the worst-case, the industry could remain shut until well into 2021. International travel The policy document notes that the reopening of international tourism and the country borders will not only be dependent on South Africa’s coronavirus response, but also 44 primary source markets which drive international tourism to the country. To help model when these countries are likely to reopen, pandemic data for individual countries was sourced and manipulated to obtain the pandemic duration, maximum number of deaths per day, date of peak daily mortality and days since peak daily mortality. Date of peak daily mortality and peak value had to be determined for each country, and if a country had not yet reached its peak, these were estimated either by extrapolation or by setting a peak number and peak factor. A linear recovery equation was found for three benchmark countries: South Korea (plateau), China (steep) and the United States (very steep). Gradients and limitations were adjusted to apply more optimistic or pessimistic assumptions and develop alternative scenarios. Lastly, using China as a benchmark, where it took 60 days to open partially and a further 30 days for full domestic opening, the Oxford Lockdown Stringency Index (LSI) was used to approximate the number of days it would take from the point of recording zero daily deaths to full opening per source country. This produced something similar to the following model: <img class="size-full wp-image-422360 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Model-1.png" alt="" width="752" height="350" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Model-1.png 752w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Model-1-300x140.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Using this data, the department forecasts a global tourism re-opening between August 2020 and early 2021. “This scenario assumes that the general observed recovery trajectory persists and that progress towards enhanced treatments for Covid-19 by the end of 2020 continue, with an accessible vaccine coming to market by the end of 2021,” the department said. “Since indications of international border re-openings remain speculative at the time of writing, these dates represent the earliest likely date at which international travel will resume.” The below model shows the estimated travel periods for South Africa’s primary ‘source countries’  for tourism. The model is set between August 2020 and May 2021;
For domestic travel (travel within the respective country), the opening window is set between August 2020 and mid-February 2021;
For international travel (to and from the respective country), the opening window is set between November 2020 and May 2021. <img class="size-full wp-image-422364 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism.png" alt="" width="1129" height="776" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism.png 1129w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-300x206.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-1024x704.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-768x528.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Localised and global reinfection While the above model provides a positive picture globally, the risk of localised or global reinfection waves continue to threaten the global economic recovery and the strength and consistency of projected recoveries therefore come with low levels of certainty. “As countries begin the process of re-opening, there remains a strong likelihood that trajectories out of lockdown conditions will prove far more fragile than hoped and that contagion risk in neighbouring countries or regions will force many nations to remain closed off from the world well into 2021,” the department said. For this reason, the department provided two further global scenarios: A more fragile recovery that contains isolated setbacks and takes longer, but still reflects an extension of the current global trajectory; A prolonged pandemic where the search for a vaccine proves elusive, herd immunity does not successfully contain transmission and multiple re-infection waves result. Under the first of these scenarios, the timeframe for early Asian/Australasian re-opening moves from July/August 2020 to November 2020, while core markets (the UK, Germany and the US) can only be expected to return after April 2021. The second scenario paints an even bleaker picture, with international outbound travel from Asia picking up between May and July 2021 and travel from core markets only returning from November 2021. <img class="size-full wp-image-422376 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-2.png" alt="" width="1216" height="800" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-2.png 1216w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-2-300x197.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-2-1024x674.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-2-768x505.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-2-1200x789.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> “In both of the more pessimistic scenarios, the 2020/21 summer season will be seriously affected, with even the following year’s peak months being under threat. “This will have grave implications for supply-side survival. Given the modelling outputs and qualitative data emerging from the market, however, the stronger international recovery scenario remains the core outlook,” the department said. It added that containment of the virus ultimately requires effective treatment and vaccine lead times will be a key indicator of the duration of the stabilisation phase. This will inform visa policies and port of entry protocols as countries without sufficient herd immunity or access to treatment will seek to limit viral vectors, it said. “In the interim, temporary and semi-permanent restrictions on traveller mobility are inevitable and unlikely to be standardised across markets. “Measures such as immunity certification, pre- and post-travel quarantine and mandatory visitor tracking will reassure travellers but also impede the visitor experience” South Africa The document notes that South Africa’s pandemic curve thus far resembles the ‘plateau’ shape of countries such as South Korea, Australia and Singapore more than it does the ‘exponential growth’ experience of China, Italy, the United Kingdom and the United States. The implication is therefore that, having successfully ‘flattened the curve’ to prevent health services from being overwhelmed, the country now faces a more prolonged, but less acute battle against the pandemic, the department said. Using the above model it used for foreign countries, it produced the three following scenarios for South Africa: A strong recovery scenario where South Africa is able to contemplate re-opening in August;
A fragile recovery scenario, where the horizon shifts out to November 2020;
A low-road, prolonged crisis scenario where the pandemic rages well into 2021. Citing data from the South African Covid-19 modelling consortium, the department said that the country is on track for a ‘middle-road recovery’. Under this outlook, South Africa recovers slower than many other parts of the world but does not lag far behind key source markets in Europe and North America. <img class="size-full wp-image-422388 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-3.png" alt="" width="807" height="665" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-3.png 807w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-3-300x247.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Tourism-3-768x633.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-422400 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Risk.png" alt="" width="773" height="351" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Risk.png 773w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Risk-300x136.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Risk-768x349.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “It is therefore likely that tourism recovery will experience a number of phases, from hyper-local community attractions, through broader domestic tourism, followed potentially by regional land and air markets, and then the resumption of world-wide international travel,” the department said. “The implementation of the government’s risk-adjusted strategy is based on sector-level risk assessments that consider transmission risk across a number of dimensions, including; age of workforce, remote working potential, ability to enforce health and safety regulations and travel considerations of employees.” You can read the full draft document below.
