The Department of Energy has published the official fuel price adjustments for September 2020, showing a marginal increase for petrol drivers, and a sizeable drop for diesel. According to the department, the following adjustments will be made on Wednesday (2 September): Petrol 93: increase of 1 cent per litre
Petrol 95: increase of 1 cent per litre
Diesel 0.05%: decrease of 21 cents per litre
Diesel 0.005%: decrease of 21 cents per litre
Illuminating paraffin: decrease of 26 cents per litre The average international product prices for Petrol, Diesel and Illuminating Paraffin decreased during the period under review, the department said, while the rand ended the month weaker against the dollar. The rand depreciated against the US dollar during the period under review, on average, when compared to the previous period. The average rand/US dollar exchange rate for the period 31 July 2020 to 27 August 2020 was R17.28 compared to R16.82 during the previous period. This led to a higher contribution to the Basic Fuel Prices on petrol, diesel and illuminating paraffin by 14.99 c/l, 15.12 c/l and 13.42 c/l respectively, it said. The price of petrol would have actually decreased in September, but the minister of Mineral Resources and Energy has approved a retail margin increase of 5.3 c/l to be effected in the retail price structures of all octane grades of petrol with effect from 02 September 2020. This increase is necessary to accommodate the wage increases of pump attendants, cashiers and administrative staff at service stations, it said.
