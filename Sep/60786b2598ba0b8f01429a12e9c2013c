Eskom says that its systems are severely constrained, forcing the company to implement stage 2 load shedding on Tuesday (1 September), from 12h00 to 22h00. The power utility said that it suffered multiple unit breakdowns, which has led to the constrains. Ten generation units at seven power stations have broken down over the last 48 hours. A generator each broke down at Armot, Medupi, Lethabo and Matla power stations, while two units each at Majuba, Cambden and Tutuka power stations have also broken down. “This, with the need to conserve energy generation reserves, necessitates that load shedding be implemented to protect the integrity of the system,” Eskom said. Unplanned breakdowns stand at 11,665MW of capacity, with 4,558MW offline for planned maintenance. Any further breakdowns may push the load shedding stage to higher levels, Eskom warned.
