What would happen if, during peak business hours, while sales are booming and your critical data is being updated, your company’s wired internet connection were to fail at one or more locations? It’s a scenario that no enterprise wants to face, but with primary internet service providers only offering 99.5% availability as standard (which equals about 4 hours of downtime monthly), the question isn’t if your internet connectivity will go down, but when. According to Gartner, every hour of downtime can typically cost an organisation hundreds of thousand rands per hour. That is why it is imperative to have a plan for branch continuity in place. Visit the Infoprotect website to learn more. In contrast to wired failover solutions or redundant service, LTE technology offers always-on, cost-effective connectivity. As a failover solution, wireless offers speeds fast enough to keep your network humming. Organisations seeking a branch continuity solution that can be trusted for always-on network connectivity should consider deploying an LTE-enabled solution to ensure maximum uptime, speed-to-deployment, cost-effective scalability, and ease of management with limited IT resources. The relatively low cost of LTE for branch continuity means a greater return on investment and scalability for multiple locations, for which other options are just simply cost-prohibitive. With a wireless failover solution, distributed enterprises can enjoy the same reliability and competitive advantage as large enterprises even, or especially, when their ADSL or fibre lines fail.
