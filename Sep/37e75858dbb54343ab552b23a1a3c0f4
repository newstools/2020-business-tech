Display branding targeting readers on smartphones. “Sponsored articles are the most trusted form of online advertising in South Africa, and a great way to promote your brand, product, or service,” said BusinessTech MD Kevin Lancaster. “A sponsored article lets you speak to your audience in a one-on-one conversation and gives your organisation a distinct character – which is a powerful way to connect with customers.” “We also see the best ROI (return on investment) for clients who use a combination of sponsored articles, social media promotions, and display branding.” Articles work perfectly for readers on laptops, PCs, tablets, and smartphones – which gives them universal appeal, added Lancaster.
