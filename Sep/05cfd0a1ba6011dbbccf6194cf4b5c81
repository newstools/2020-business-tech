Volkswagen has launched the most powerful derivative of the Amarok – a 3.0-litre V6 TDI with 190kW power output added to its model line-up in South Africa. The German carmaker said that the Amarok Double Cab will be available in the last quarter of 2020. The Amarok range which was launched in South Africa in 2010, has sold almost 35 000 units (single and double cab) in the local market. VW said that the Amarok Double Cab was Volkswagen Commercial Vehicles’ best-selling derivative last year with 2,596 vehicles sold. As of November 2020, the Amarok model range in South Africa, Namibia and Botswana will consist of the following engines; the 2.0 TDI 103kW, 2.0 BiTDI 132kW and the 3.0 TDI V6 190kW. “The biggest development with this addition to the Amarok range is under the bonnet. The most powerful Amarok distinguishes itself from the rest of the range through the new 3.0-litre V6 190kW TDI engine, which has 25kW more power as well as 30Nm more torque than the outgoing 165kW derivative,” it said. The Amarok 3.0-litre V6 TDI generates 190kW from 3,000 to 4,500 rpm and 580 Newton metres of torque from 1,400 to 2,750 rpm which is channelled through its standard eight-speed automatic gearbox, VW said.

It has an average fuel consumption of 9.5 litres per 100 kilometres. “With an over boost function that powers the Amarok to a maximum power output of 200kW for 10 seconds, it is also one of the most powerful bakkies on sale in South Africa at the moment, the German carmaker said.
