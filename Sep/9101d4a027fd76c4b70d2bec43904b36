Eskom says that it will reduce load shedding to stage 2 on Saturday, with power cuts set to continue for the rest of the weekend. Stage 2 load shedding will be implemented from 08h00 to 22h00 on both Saturday and Sunday. This is necessary to replenish the emergency generation reserves which were depleted over the week, it said. Eskom said that the system remains unreliable and vulnerable, and it warned that the level of load shedding could change should there be any further developments.
