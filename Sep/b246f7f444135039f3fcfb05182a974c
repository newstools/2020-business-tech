Black Friday 2020 will take place on 27 November, and this year is expected to see a big increase in the number of people shopping online. This is thanks to COVID-19 bringing ecommerce to the fore. In fact, a recent survey reported on by Google reveals that 73% of consumers said their shopping behaviour has changed since the pandemic hit – with an increased likelihood to purchase more online. The question for businesses wanting to get customers to buy from them during Black Friday then becomes: What is the best way to reach people who are more likely to shop online? The answer is simple: Online advertising. It is important for companies to note, however, that Black Friday is more than just one day. Research by Google shows that for shoppers, Black Friday is a 10-week period of research, reviews, and purchasing – and starts in October. “It is essential for brands to capture this broad spectrum of interaction and influence by maintaining a presence across the consumer’s purchase journey,” said Google. It then went on to detail the “3 stages of Black Friday” for shoppers. Stage 1 – The Build-Up Black Friday research starts weeks before the actual day, in early October. Shoppers are looking for potential deals and are open to suggestions. Stage 2 – The Craze In the two weeks leading up to Black Friday – and the week of Black Friday – people look for specific products, brands, and deals. This includes research, and reading reviews and features on the products or services they want to buy. Stage 3 – The Last Call Shopper continue to look for deals two weeks after Black Friday is complete – including on Cyber Monday. “Consumers [are]… hoping to take advantage of steeper Black Friday discounts and prepare for the upcoming holiday season,” stated Google.
