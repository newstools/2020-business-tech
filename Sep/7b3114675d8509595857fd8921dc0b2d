Toyota has launched its new Starlet hatchback in South Africa, the first car to come out of a new brand alliance between Toyota and Suzuki. The Starlet is powered by a 1.4-litre four-cylinder engine generating 68kW at 6,000 rpm with 130Nm of torque at 4,200 rpm. Two transmission choices on offer include a 5-speed manual and 4-speed automatic, all driving the front wheels. Toyota said that the manual Starlet is capable of 0-100km/h in 10.9 seconds, while the automatic variant can reach 0-100km/h in 11.6 seconds. Toyota said that low fuel consumption is a key feature, with the fuel index registering between 5.1 and 5.4 litres/100 km depending on variant. A 37-litre fuel tank provides an effective range of over 700km on a single tank. Towing capacity weighs in at 400kg unbraked and 1,000kg braked. <img class="wp-image-434981 size-large aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-768x511.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-side-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="wp-image-434983 size-large aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-768x512.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-1536x1023.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-2048x1364.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-front-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="wp-image-434985 size-large aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-1024x682.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="559" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-1024x682.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-768x511.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-1536x1022.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-2048x1363.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Starlet-back-1200x799.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Models The Starlet is available in Xi, Xs and Xr symbols. “Despite serving as the entry point to the Starlet range, the Xi model is generously specced, featuring air-conditioning, electric power steering, dual 12-volt power outlets, electric windows, tilt-adjustable steering column, 60/40 split rear seats, power-adjustable side mirrors and remote central locking,” Toyota said.
