New data from AutoTrader shows an increasing interest for vehicles that cost less than R250,000, particularly hatchbacks. The vehicle marketplace noted that Volkswagen Polo is the country’s most searched for hatch, being the most popular passenger vehicle in the country, while Volkswagen dominates this important segment of the motor industry. AutoTrader’s data during the month of August, shows that while the Polo was the most searched-for hatchback in the sub R250,000 price bracket, the list of top 10 models contained no fewer than three Volkswagen derivatives – the Golf emerged second while the Polo Vivo came fourth. AutoTrader chief executive officer, George Mienie said that the sub R250,000 sector was one of the most popular price range segments within the hatchback market during Lockdown level 2. “This price bracket constituted a massive 72.3% of price-related searches for hatchbacks during August,” he said. According to the 2020 AutoTrader Car Industry Report, hatchbacks are the body-type with the lowest selling price and mileage combination, and they’re also the most sold body-type in the country. In the last year, they accounted for 31% of the total used cars sold in South Africa. The 2020 AutoTrader Car Industry Report found that the Polo was the second most sold used car in South Africa in the last year, contributing 4.7% of all cars sold, at an average selling price of R205,238, an average mileage of 58,652km and an average year model of 2016. Similarly, the Golf – in second place for most searched hatches in August in the sub-R250,000 – is not a surprise listing. “One of the models in the Golf range, the iconic GTI, also performed well last year, achieving first place in the AutoTrader Car Industry Report when it comes to variant searches. It was responsible for a substantial 1.5 million searches,” said Mienie.
