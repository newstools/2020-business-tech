Openserve is continuing with its drive to migrate customers using copper-based ADSL internet to fibre-based infrastructure as it battles with connectivity challenges brought on by cable theft and the speed limitations of copper infrastructure. Initially, the deadline for migration was set for end of August, but this was subsequently moved to end of November, it said. The deadline was extended to ensure that both ISPs and end consumers are given ample time to complete their migrations. “Consumers who are currently using ADSL, and who are in an Openserve fibred area, are encouraged to contact their Internet Service Provider (ISP) for more information and assistance before the end of November 2020. “From end November 2020, we hope to welcome consumers on to the faster, leading-edge fibre technology. Openserve will stop supporting and maintaining all copper network infrastructure in areas already covered with our fibre network,” says Althon Beukes, chief executive of Openserve. “We encourage consumers to contact their ISPs and check whether their area is one of the many areas we’ve already upgraded. We are working closely with our partner ISPs in ensuring that no one is without connectivity and has been migrated to our fibre infrastructure.” Openserve has published a full list of areas affected here. The company said that it will continue to support, maintain, and provide broadband services in areas where it is yet to build out end to end fibre infrastructure. It also encouraged customers to contact their ISP for information and for a deal that will suit their needs at a price they can afford.
