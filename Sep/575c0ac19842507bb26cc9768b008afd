Used car inventories – especially when it comes to ‘nearly new’ cars – increased by 32% in July 2020 compared to the previous month, placing buyers firmly in the pound seats, says AutoTrader. Buyers of older used cars are also scoring; total inventory listings have increased by nearly 20% month-on-month (June to July 2020). According to AutoTrader, the 2019 registration year car with the most active listings is the Volkswagen Polo. The average selling price of a 2019 Polo is R221,492 while the average mileage is 22,448 km,” said George Mienie, chief executive officer of AutoTrader. In second place in terms of active listings of 2019 models is yet another Volkswagen derivative, namely the Polo Vivo. The average selling price of a 2019 Polo Vivo is R178,994 while the average mileage is 23,338 km. Mienie noted that Toyota vehicles account for half of the models when it comes to the top 10 2019 registration year cars with the most active listings. “This is not surprising, given the fact that the Japanese carmaker does sell the most new vehicles in South Africa,” he said. The Toyota Corolla Quest, Toyota Yaris and Toyota Etios are in third, fourth and fifth place respectively. The average selling price of a 2019 Corolla Quest is R190,362 and the average mileage is 26,883 km. The average selling price of a 2019 Yaris is R217,796 while the average mileage is 26,598 km. The average selling price of a 2019 Etios is R158,815 and the average mileage is 27,652 km. The other two Toyotas in the top 10, the Fortuner and RAV4 (in seventh and eighth place), have average selling prices of R479,378 and R391,156 respectively. Cash-strapped South Africans will no doubt cheer at the news that there are lots of 2019 Datsun Go’s available for sale. “At a mere R123,157, this is a really great deal. This represents a significant saving over the price of a new Go, which starts at R174,200,” Mienie said. Perhaps surprisingly, the most sold used car in South Africa – the Ford Ranger – only clocks in tenth. It has an average selling price of R452,667.
