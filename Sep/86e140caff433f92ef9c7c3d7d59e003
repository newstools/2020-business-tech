Government has identified a number of challenges that continue to contribute to the high unemployment rate amongst the youth in South Africa. Responding in a recent written parliamentary Q&A session, Employment and Labour minister Thulas Nxesi, said that key issues include: The structural nature of the South African economy; Low economic growth levels compounded by insufficient investments by the private and public sector in new ventures and infrastructure; Socio-economic challenges and the high poverty levels that remain amongst blacks and in some instances contributing to school dropouts especially in peri-urban and rural areas; Limited skill acquisition and resultant inadequate preparation of youth for entry into the world of work; Rapid changes in the labour market fuelled by digitisation and automation. Nxesi said that the Covid-19 pandemic has further added to the above challenges. “Within government, great strides have been made in improving employability of young people through interventions in the education system but more still needs to be done. Government has also implemented a number of interventions to address the youth unemployment problem,” he said. Some of the initiatives that have been introduced Department of Employment and Labour include; The Promulgation of the Employment Services Act 2014 was introduced to guide the Department in its free services to promote youth employment.
