Eskom will implement stage 1 and 2 load shedding on Monday and Tuesday. The power utility reduced load shedding to stage 1 at 12h00 on Sunday (6 September) and plans to implement stage 1 and stage 2 load-shedding between 08h00 and 22h00 over the next two days. “Starting at midday today, Eskom reduced load shedding to stage 1, which will last until 22:00 tonight,” Eskom said. “Tomorrow stage 1 load shedding will resume at 08h00 and last until 16h00. Tomorrow, stage 1 load shedding will resume at 08h00 and last until 16h00. It will then escalate to stage 2 until 22:00. “This pattern will repeat on Tuesday, with a high likelihood for Wednesday as well,” the power utility said. Eskom said it would continue to communicate timeously should there be any changes, as the system remains unreliable and vulnerable. It added that load shedding was necessary this weekend in order to replenish the emergency generation reserves, which were depleted over the past week. “Eskom teams are working around the clock to return as many of these generation units to service as possible,” it said. “We urge the people of South Africa to help reduce electricity usage in order to assist Eskom to reduce the instance of load-shedding,” said Eskom.
