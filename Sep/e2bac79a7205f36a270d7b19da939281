Electric Life Rides, a South African electric scooter and vehicle tech company, is set to launch its service in Cape Town in early September 2020. The initial fleet of electric kick scooters will be available at the group’s new mobility hub and partner, The President Hotel in Bantry Bay. Electric Life Rides works through a mobile app – similar to Uber – powered by vehicle-sharing platform creators, Wunder Mobility. Users are able to scan a barcode on the kick scooter to download the app and activate it, and are then able to buy ride credits directly through the app, using a bank card. The technology will bring dock-free electric kick scooter rental to South Africa. Users will experience on-demand options to change between hardware, and the ability to ride per minute, hour, day or month cost-effectively with a modern mechanism that doesn’t require traditional ownership experience and obligations, it said. Electric Life Rides said it will offer a subscription-based model to the South African market for the first 60 days. R1,980 per month will get you a package which includes the commercial electric scooter and charger, unlimited mileage and credits for the month, built-in tracking for safety and the ability to move freely through traffic congestion, it said. The scooter is controlled by the user, using the app to lock and unlock the scooter. “The vehicles also have built-in tracking systems, providing convenience, peace of mind and security by making it easy to locate the nearest vehicle. “The vehicle tracking technology also features Application Programming Interface (API) functionality, providing interface ability with other applications, for example food and medicine delivery. This also allows control of usage parameters including route control, speed and more,” the group said. “Our vision was to build and launch a tech company and app that will effectively disrupt, challenge and reshape the way we move and commute by providing innovative options and electronic micro mobility vehicles to Africa,” said Electric Life Group CEO, Stefan Van der Sandt. “We do have plans to span globally as soon as possible with Europe, UAE and USA already in our sights. We want to assist in creating a better tomorrow, where people move in a better way, a greener, cleaner Electric Life Rides way, whilst reducing carbon emissions as well as creating local employment,” he said. Electric Life Rides will be launching exclusively with Electric Kick Scooters in September. Details on further product introductions, additional fleet locations and partners will be announced as they are confirmed. The planned product range will expand to offer five options including four-wheeled vehicles. Electric Life Rides said it will offer a shared revenue split model to businesses that want to deploy on their real estate/location and operate/manage a fleet of scooters from their site to the public. These electric kick scooters can be used for package or food delivery, document collection or delivery, commuting around office parks and estates, warehouses, security patrol or simple efficiency for commuting purposes. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431036" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/11_Electric-Life-Rides-e1599120654497.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431034" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/3_Electric-Life-Rides-e1599120635755.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431044" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/4_Electric-Life-Rides-e1599120989460.png" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-431042" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5_Electric-Life-Rides.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="960" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5_Electric-Life-Rides.jpg 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5_Electric-Life-Rides-300x225.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5_Electric-Life-Rides-1024x768.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5_Electric-Life-Rides-768x576.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/5_Electric-Life-Rides-1200x900.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: Lime electric scooter service launching in Cape Town
