Reeflords will guide you through your Offer to Purchase (OTP), bond application specifics, and your FICA documentation submissions — all of which can be done digitally. To make sure you don’t miss an important signature on the paperwork, your assigned Reeflords representative will guide you through the signing process and mandatories of all transfer and bond documents. You will then be encouraged to take a walk through your new home and shortlist any of the items that you feel need further attention – and should you need any inspection guidance, your Reeflords representative will be on hand. Where applicable, the payment of bond costs will require settlement through which your assigned Reeflords representative will guide you. The last step is registration of the property in your name, a handover of all necessary finalised paperwork, and the set of keys to your new home. “At Reeflords, we are as proud of the momentous milestone that buying a new home is as you are.
