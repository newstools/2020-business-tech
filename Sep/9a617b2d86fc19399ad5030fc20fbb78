Car brands need to give customers the option to book a test drive, and buy a car, online. This is according to research from Google, which highlighted a strong growth in the number of people willing to conduct research and the purchase of a car online. The latest acceleration towards online car shopping is due to the COVID-19 pandemic, which forced many car dealerships to close their doors – and saw people doing a lot more online shopping. “If other industries serve as a guide, this is more than a passing trend. People will likely continue to buy cars online even now that showrooms are reopening,” said Google. Online searches for “car sales” have grown by over 60% year-over-year across the world, while searches for “best car under” have grown globally by over 80% year-over-year, added Google. “As distancing measures continue, 64% of new auto buyers said they would look for even more information online.” The research went on to detail the high number of shoppers who would like to book an at-home test drive online and structure the terms of their car purchase online. “In our latest research, 98% of shoppers who were offered an at-home test drive found it helpful with decision-making,” stated the research. 73% of shoppers also said they were happy negotiating purchase, lease, or financing terms for their car completely online, or through a mix of online and offline. “For the auto industry, driving digital transformation means delivering a blended retail model that combines online strategies and traditional dealership-based interactions,” concluded the research.
