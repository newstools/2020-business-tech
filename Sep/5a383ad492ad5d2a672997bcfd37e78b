Electric vehicle and clean energy giant Tesla has opened up online reservations for its Powerwall battery pack in South Africa, which will set you back R166,800. Powerwall is a home battery that stores excess energy for use when you need it, provides backup power to your home during grid outages, and keeps your appliances running in your home at night or during grid outages. “Customers for Tesla’s Energy products in South Africa can now find out more, reserve, or enquire through a new South African webpage,” Tesla said in a statement. “Customers can learn about Tesla’s rechargeable home battery and businesses and utilities can find out more about industrial and utility-scale battery storage in the form of Megapack.” The system can be paired with solar energy grids, which will recharge the batteries during sunlight hours. Without solar, the batteries are recharged from the main energy grid. The Powerwall has been available in South Africa for a few years, imported through distributor Rubicon. However, this marks the first time that Tesla has made the product available locally, directly. The unit itself costs R143,300, with installation fees amounting to R23,300. The most recent pricing for a Powerwall through Rubicon was quoted at R223,450, which includes the grid system used to charge it. Once a reservation has been placed, a Tesla energy specialist will contact prospective buyers to discuss their energy needs, the group said. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-433923" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powerwall-specs.png" alt="" width="918" height="606" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powerwall-specs.png 1301w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powerwall-specs-300x198.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powerwall-specs-1024x676.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powerwall-specs-768x507.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/powerwall-specs-1200x792.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The original Powerwall was available in South Africa from early 2016. Amid rolling blackouts across the country due to load shedding over the last few years, South Africans have been looking to alternative energy solutions to help keep the lights on. Distributors have noted strong growth in the sale of solar grids, generators, uninterruptable power supplies (UPS) and battery packs in the country, on the back of load shedding. Those who can afford backup power solutions, like Powerwall, can mitigate the effects of load shedding and keep essential devices like lights, PCs, TVs, and routers running despite their power being out.
