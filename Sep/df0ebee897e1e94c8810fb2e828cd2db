Streaming company Netflix has launched two new subscription plans in South Africa that are aimed specifically at mobile devices. The Mobile and Mobile+ plans are priced at R39 and R59 per month respectively, with the more expensive plan also allowing users to watch shows on their laptops. The Netflix Mobile plan offers one simultaneous stream and supports smartphones and tablets, and allows users to stream at a resolution of up to 480p. Netflix Mobile+ also supports up to 480p for streaming and allows users to watch on their laptop or desktop computer as well as mobile phones and tablets. MyBroadband reports that Netflix still seems to be rolling out these packages locally, and visitors to Netflix’s signup page may be presented with either option. <img class="size-full wp-image-433174 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mobile.png" alt="" width="981" height="766" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mobile.png 981w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mobile-300x234.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Mobile-768x600.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The new plans are much cheaper than Netflix’s existing three packages – Basic, Standard, and Premium. These plans are aimed at TV users , with the highest package offering up to 4K+ HDR support. Netflix Mobile and Mobile+ have rolled out to a number of other countries, with Mobile+ first becoming available in India earlier this year. In a letter to investors published in July 2019 the company said it has been testing this plan in a number of countries and that it was looking to expand into markets where the average revenue per user for Pay TV is lower than $5. “After several months of testing, we’ve decided to roll out a lower-priced mobile-screen plan in India to complement our existing plans,” Netflix said. “We believe this plan, which will launch in Q3, will be an effective way to introduce a larger number of people in India to Netflix and to further expand our business in a market where Pay TV ARPU is low (below $5).” Read: South Africans have stopped paying their TV licences – this is what the SABC is doing about it
