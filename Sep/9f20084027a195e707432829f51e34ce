Professional services company Ernst & Young (EY), in association with Hult International Business School, has announced the first-ever fully virtual Master of Business Administration (MBA), with a focus on technology. The ‘Tech MBA’ will be available free to all 284,000 EY employees in more than 150 countries, including South Africa, irrespective of prior qualifications, the company said. EY said that the entire programme will be delivered online and that fourteen African EY employees have already qualified to enter the programme. Hult International Business School is a private business school with campuses in many of the world’s most influential cities such as Cambridge, London, San Francisco, Dubai, New York City and Shanghai. Roderick Wolfenden, EY Africa Markets Leader based in Johannesburg, said that the dramatic rise of the importance and integration of technology, particularly evident during the months of lockdown, means the launch of the new MBA has launched at the right time. “Just about every business is now in some way also a technology business. Successful businesses rely heavily on technology for communication, productivity and keeping up with advancements in industry. “It’s very exciting to help people to acquire specialist knowledge so they apply it in the workplace to help solve big problems.” Wolfenden said that students will learn how to harness the power of new technologies like Artificial Intelligence (AI), blockchain, robotics as well as diversity and sustainable business practices. “Students will also be able to tailor their own curriculums to be uniquely placed to help businesses navigate an age of unprecedented disruption,” he said.
