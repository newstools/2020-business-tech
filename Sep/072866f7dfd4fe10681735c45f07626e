Eskom says that it will reduce load shedding to stage 3 on Friday – though rolling blackouts will continue into the weekend. Stage 3 load shedding will be implemented from 08h00 to 22h00 on Friday, with further changes and forecasts for the weekend to be announced as they occur. The reduction to stage 3 is due to reduced demand and improved weather, it said. “In order to replenish emergency generation reserves, load shedding will continue into the weekend. The system remains unreliable and vulnerable,” it said. Generation units have returned at Tutuka, Matla, Majuba and Camden power stations, however two additional units have suffered breakdowns. Unplanned outages amount to 11,185MW, with a further 5,040MW out in planned maintenance.
