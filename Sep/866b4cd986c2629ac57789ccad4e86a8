The R2 billion-plus redevelopment of Johannesburg’s inner-city district, dubbed Jewel City, is preparing to launch on Heritage Day, 24 September. The development, which broke ground in 2018, is a mixed-use precinct spanning six city blocks. Jewel City is located in the eastern CBD of Johannesburg, on Fox Street, between the existing Maboneng and Absa precincts. Atterbury, the developers said the plan is to open up the precinct which has been closed to the public for several years, and ‘pedestrianise’ Fox Street, creating a safe, green, space for people to enjoy. The project is under the management of DiverCity, which is partnership between Atterbury and iThemba Property – previously Circlevest. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-433883" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03.png" alt="" width="1196" height="797" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03.png 1827w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03-300x200.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03-1024x683.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03-768x512.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03-1536x1024.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Jewel-City-03-1200x800.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Upon completion, the new district will include: 20,000 square metres of commercial office space
