South Africa Discovery said that the SA business demonstrated resilience amid the difficult economic and operating environment.

Discovery Health Medical Scheme (DHMS) grew open medical scheme market share to 56.8% in a declining market, Discovery said. “The operating result and solvency were higher than expected as a result of the reduction in health system utilisation during lockdown, which included a 27.5% reduction in hospital admissions at the end of August 2020.” Discovery said that its bank’s performance ‘was pleasing’, with over 370,000 accounts at end June (489,000 at 13 September) and deposits of R2.4 billion (R3.7 billion at 13 September). Looking ahead, Discovery said that its ‘Ambition 2023’ remains the strategic focus for the medium-term. The group is well positioned for growth over its planning horizon to 2023, with the capital plan able to fund its new initiatives. “The businesses within the South African composite have created significant insurgency and the composite is well positioned to continue the SA growth trajectory.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-433733" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Discovery.png" alt="" width="758" height="366" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Discovery.png 758w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/Discovery-300x145.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Adrian Gore on what’s next for Discovery Bank in South Africa
