The Pod-Idlala is a modular, prefabricated nano-home which is designed and manufactured in South Africa. The home’s name ‘iDladla’ is slang for ‘my place’ and the pod is designed to be portable. Each pod is a standard size but can be coupled together in different configurations to create larger spaces. The lightweight structure is suitable for any 24 square metre open space. It can be installed as an on-grid pod, connected to existing services, or alternatively as a stand-alone off-grid pod in more remote areas. The pod requires small footings to help distribute its load on the specific soil type. Depending on the location, it might also require earth-anchors. This means that pod requires council approval, but as a temporary structure the approval process is much simpler compared to a permanent structure. The total area, including the mezzanine, for the bare bones option is 17 square metres, and it includes a deck. <img class="size-full wp-image-449737 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome6.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1125" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome6.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome6-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome6-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-449739 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PdHome5.jpg" alt="" width="750" height="1125" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PdHome5.jpg 750w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PdHome5-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PdHome5-683x1024.jpg 683w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-449741 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome4.jpg" alt="" width="727" height="1091" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome4.jpg 727w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome4-200x300.jpg 200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/PodHome4-682x1024.jpg 682w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> To save on transport costs the prefabricated components are assembled on-site by an approved installer.
