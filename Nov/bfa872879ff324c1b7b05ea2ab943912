Renewable power generation company, Lekela, has announced that its 140MW Kangnas wind farm in South Africa has successfully reached commercial operations. This marks the completion of all five wind farms in a Lekela-led consortium across South Africa. Together, these total over 600MW and will provide clean, cost-effective power for up to 485,000 South African homes over the next 20 years. The Kangnas wind farm is situated just over 50km east of the town of Springbok in the Nama Khoi Local Municipality of the Northern Cape. Construction for the project began in 2018 and has been achieved with 50% of construction content manufactured locally in South Africa, including the site’s two transformers. “Kangnas wind farm also committed to drive local job creation on top of manufacturing, providing over 550 jobs at the height of the project’s construction. Long-term operations and maintenance jobs will also be supported while the 61 Siemens SWT-2.3-108 wind turbines generate electricity for 20 years, the group said. Kangnas follows the 110MW Perdekraal East wind farm which entered operation in October. Perdekraal East was the first wind farm from Round 4 of the Renewable Energy Independent Power Producers Procurement Programme to do so, with Kangnas now following it. Lekela’s first wind farm in South Africa, Noupoort, was likewise the first project from Round 3 to reach commercial operation, back in 2016. “Just five years after Lekela was created, this is a significant milestone for us all. Kangnas completes what only existed as ideas on a piece of paper just a few years ago,” said Chris Antonopoulos, chief executive officer at Lekela. “We now have over 600MW of wind power in operation, which will supply clean electricity to hundreds of thousands of South Africans, at an affordable price for the next two decades. Our completed portfolio places Lekela firmly as one of the leading providers of clean, renewable energy in the country, and across the African continent more broadly. He said that no other source of energy has the pace of development, nor the backing of governments, communities and companies that wind and solar do. “We have to capitalise on this appetite to ensure the number of Africans without access to electricity continues to fall, not rise, in the next decade.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-448949" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Kangas-e1605536085955.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-439237" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2.jpg" alt="" width="2000" height="1125" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2.jpg 2000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-439217" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Lekela-1-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Read: A look at South Africa’s massive new wind farm that just launched in the Western Cape
