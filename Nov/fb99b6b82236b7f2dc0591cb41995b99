Whether you are working in the office or from your home, you are using a screen throughout the day. This is because the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the importance of having a display that enables you to communicate with your colleagues and customers efficiently. Click here to learn more about the ASUS BE24EQK business monitor. ASUS is synonymous with high-quality computing hardware and its monitors are a key part of its product range. It has introduced the perfect display for web video meetings and chats, live-streaming, online learning, and for anyone who requires video and audio capturing for commercial use –  such as banks. The ASUS BE24EQK monitor is a great solution for users who need a monitor that enables the new way of working that the COVID-19 pandemic has brought upon us. The standout feature of the ASUS BE24EQK is its integrated communications hardware. We all know how awkward it can be to set up your peripheral hardware whenever you need to jump into a video call. Sometimes your microphone just won’t work, or your webcam isn’t showing your picture – no matter what settings you try. Not only is this frustrating; it is also unprofessional to delay a meeting for these reasons. This is why ASUS has integrated a full suite of communications hardware into its BE24EQK monitor – ensuring you are always ready to jump into a video call at a moment’s notice. The monitor boasts a Full HD webcam which uses a 2MP sensor and is easy to rotate in multiple directions – including a 315-degree swivel and 20-degree tilt. This means you can display yourself clearly to the other members of the call and can adjust how you are recorded to ensure your call runs smoothly. The webcam has a sliding shutter, too, which guarantees your privacy when you are not using the webcam. ASUS has then installed a high-quality built-in microphone array that uses beam-forming technology to filter out ambient noise. This ensures you can be heard clearly – even if you are in a busy environment such as an office, or if you are working at home while your children are making noise. After all, there is nothing worse than being in a call with someone and hearing all sorts of sound in the background, as it is distracting and can make it difficult to hear what the speaker is saying. The clarity of your speech is improved even further by echo-cancellation technology, which uses innovative technology to make your voice crystal clear. Additionally, you don’t need headphones to listen to presentations or communicate, as the BE24EQK has two built in 2W speakers. These speakers provide crisp and clear sound, letting you can hear your colleagues as clearly as they can hear you. The ASUS BE24EQK isn’t just an audio tool, however – it offers the impressive visual quality that users have come to expect from ASUS displays. The BE24EQK is a 24-inch Full HD IPS monitor that uses a wide-viewing-angle frameless panel which provides consistent and accurate colour – no matter what angle you are looking from. This monitor is also VESA-mountable, which means it is easy to hang on a wall or a mounting arm – saving you space on your desk. ASUS understands that users stare at their displays for hours each day, and have therefore prioritised eye care by adding ASUS Eye Care Technology. To this end, the ASUS BE24EQK is TUVRheinland certified as offering “Flicker Free Low Blue Light Content.” If you are in the market for a professional monitor that can handle the new way of working, the ASUS BE24EQK is the perfect solution. It comes with 3-year system and panel warranties, and there are many resources that can be found online – such as user manuals, software, and drivers.
