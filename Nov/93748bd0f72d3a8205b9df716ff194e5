The Department of Higher Education has published the full list of high-demand occupations in South Africa, which includes a deeper assessment of the positions that will likely see a faster and slower recovery from Covid-19. The list – which is reviewed every two years – highlights the occupations that show relatively strong employment growth and/or are experiencing shortages in the labour market, or which are expected to be in demand in future. “The processes to identify high demand occupations would be incomplete without taking into account the effects of the Covid-19 pandemic,” the department said. “As is well known, the Covid-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on the South African economy. Besides its overall economic shock, the pandemic is likely to change the composition of the South African economy fundamentally. This means that strong industries might struggle, while previously weaker industries might thrive, it said. “Exactly how this will happen is still highly uncertain, and there is not enough certainty to remove or add any occupations purely based on the potential changes the pandemic might bring about. As a result, the development of the list drew on cases in which industry representatives specifically argued for an occupation’s inclusion or exclusion based on Covid-19 considerations.” As many as 345 occupations have been listed by the department, with 195 highlighted as being more likely to face a slow recovery and lower demand in a post-Covid-19 South Africa, and 73 jobs showing higher demand and a faster recovery. The department said that while the list shows in-demand occupations, it is not intended to signal shortages, and it is not intended to be used to inform the recruitment of critically skilled foreign nationals. These are the jobs highlighted by the department as showing a faster recovery, and stronger demand in the future: Read: Gauteng is setting aside R1.3 billion for jobs – here’s where it is going
