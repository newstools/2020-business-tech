Mobile operator MTN will offer its Black Friday 2020 deals for an extended period of two weeks starting from 20 November. The group said that it will offer deals to new and existing customers covering prepaid, contract, enterprise/ business and mobile money (MTN MoMo) products until 9 December. “We understand that what people need now, perhaps more than ever before, are true money-saving bargains that could offer some relief, and a better way to stay connected to family, friends and work,” said Jacqui O’Sullivan, executive for Corporate Affairs at MTN SA. “While lockdown restrictions have become a bit more relaxed over the past couple of months, we still felt that it would be best to extend the shopping period to reduce the number of shoppers in stores at a given time. “This is, of course, over and above continuing to ensure that all other appropriate safety measures are in place in-store to protect customers and staff during this busier-than-usual shopping period.” The biggest deals are outlined in more detail below.

The group said that customers can also get a 80% off a range of other MTN daily and weekly data bundles during the Black Friday period, by dialling *151# or by using the MTN MoMo app. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-449981" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MTN.png" alt="" width="640" height="259" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MTN.png 608w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/MTN-300x121.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Prepaid deals MTN said that PayAsYouGo customers can buy a MiFi router that comes with 50GB of promotional data for R499 once-off.
