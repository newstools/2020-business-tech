President Cyril Ramaphosa has appointed Tsakani Maluleke as auditor-general of South Africa for a non-renewable term of seven years with effect from 1 December 2020. The auditor-general looks at strategic government objectives, programmes and initiatives and responds to identified risks in its audit work. Its role has grown increasingly prominent in South Africa as the government has been made to account for years of corruption and wasteful expenditure. Maluleke succeeds Kimi Makwetu who passed away due to illness on 11 November 2020, just weeks before the expiry of his term of office. She has served as deputy auditor-general since 2014. Maluleke is a chartered accountant and registered auditor who holds a B Comm (accounting) and a post-draduate diploma in accountancy from the University of Cape Town. She also obtained a post-graduate diploma in Development and Public Management from the University of the Witwatersrand in 2016. In addition to her role as deputy-auditor general, Maluleke served on the Presidential BEE Advisory Council where she led a sub-committee that developed recommendations that influenced key amendments to legislation and regulations relating to Broad-Based Black Economic Empowerment. “Ms Maluleke has more than 20 years of experience in the private and public sectors, spanning diverse areas including Auditing, Consulting, Corporate Advisory, Development Finance, Investment Management and Skills Development Agencies,” the presidency said in a statement. “Since 2014 she has served as the deputy auditor-general and CEO of the Office of the Auditor-General of South Africa.
