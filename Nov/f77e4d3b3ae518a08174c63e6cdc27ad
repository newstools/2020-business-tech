Power utility Eskom said Wednesday (4 November), that it is attending to  major outages in Gauteng, caused by ‘multiple network faults’. Eskom said that the areas of Lanseria, Morningside, Mulderdrift, Paulshof, Petervale, Soweto and Zandspruit are experiencing an ‘extended power supply interruption’. This, it said, is due to faults on its network, coupled with storms affecting the areas. The South African Weather Service warned of thunderstorms in Gauteng on Wednesday, leading to possible flooding. It said that the storms were likely to continue into Thursday. “The Eskom recovery teams are working around the clock towards repairing the faults and damages to restore supply to the affected areas,” Eskom said in a statement.  Bloomberg, meanwhile, reported that South Africa’s biggest cities are preparing to source their own power after the energy ministry this month approved letting them wean themselves off the state utility that’s subjected cities to outages for the past 13 years. Johannesburg and Cape Town, which have a combined population of about 10 million people, plan to diversify away from the electricity produced mainly from coal by Eskom Holdings SOC Ltd to more sustainable sources such as solar and power generated from landfill gas.
