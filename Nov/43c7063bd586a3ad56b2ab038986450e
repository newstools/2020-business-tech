Reddy studied at the University of Cape Town, where she obtained a Bachelor of Business Science degree. In this episode of Business Talk with Michael Avery, Reddy talks about the impact of Covid-19 – big and small – in the market, which has left everyone in the value chain in an uncertain phase. She said that Covid-19 brought about something she has never seen in her years in capital markets. Reddy talks thorough some of the interesting challenges faced by the JSE during lockdown, including virtual listings, and AGMs, and how some of those innovations will likely shape the industry. The listings expert also looks at how the bourse is aiming to bring in fresh capital, with new initiatives in the pipeline, while answering the questions about the impact that new competitors have had in the stock exchange space.
