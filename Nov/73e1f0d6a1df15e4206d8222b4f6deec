Especially in a post-pandemic environment, business extends beyond brick and mortar. The ‘internet of things’ reaches far beyond wires. Digital technologies change the way retail branches connect with their customers. The edge of the network is wherever you need it to be. It connects people, places and things around the corner, within the city, across the globe — and through the cloud. It’s why our world is moving beyond wires.  To this point, pop-up networks are increasingly important across a broad range of industries, helping organisations serve customers and do business in innovative new ways. Trends including field workforces and temporary retail are driving the need for pop-up connectivity that is secure, easy to deploy anywhere, and can be monitored and managed without sending IT professionals to each site. Pop-up networks are increasingly important across a broad range of industries, helping organisations serve customers and do business in innovative new ways. Trends including field workforces and temporary retail are driving the need for pop-up connectivity that is secure, easy to deploy anywhere, and can be monitored and managed without sending IT professionals to each site. When it comes to taking your QSR or branch-related business off-site, there can be various networking challenges, including unavailable or unreliable wired connectivity, unpredictable and sometimes exorbitant costs, and finally, sub-standard information security that puts your business at risk. With Infoprotect’s Cradlepoint solutions in place, the benefits counter these downsides perfectly. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-453216" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cradlepoint_Article_03_Infographic.png" alt="Cradlepoint_Article_03_Infographic" width="640" height="349" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cradlepoint_Article_03_Infographic.png 640w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Cradlepoint_Article_03_Infographic-300x164.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Many organisations ensure reliable pop-up connectivity through Cradlepoint’s cloud-managed LTE-enabled branch routers. With the ability to create secure LTE connections and make WiFi available, companies have the flexibility to set up instantly, enabling high availability for important applications. LTE is a plug-and-play option that standardises a company’s pop-up WAN costs across the entire country, with reliance on one or two network operators instead of a different ISP in each and every town. Cradlepoint’s all-in-one branch solutions include a firewall, easy VPN setup, content filtering, and IPS/IDS — allowing organisations to keep all types of data secure from one site to the next. Staying on the edge of wireless innovation is hard, but that’s OK. We were built for this. As a certified and preferred Cradlepoint provider in South Africa, Infoprotect can connect your business today — putting you on the pathway to 5G, Private LTE, and beyond.
