The South African Revenue Service (SARS) says that individual taxpayers who are required to file an income return have until Monday (16 November) to submit returns via the online platforms, namely the SARS MobiApp or eFiling. The revenue collector said that provisional taxpayers who use eFiling have until 29 January 2021 to submit their returns. “Taxpayers who have received auto-assessment from SARS, which means their returns have automatically been filed and assessed, are reminded that they must accept the assessment or edit their return on eFiling. Tax season for individual taxpayers who file at a branch closed on Thursday 22 October 2020. The revenue service said it will ‘deal decisively’ with non-compliance such as the non-submission or late submission of returns. However, SARS said that not every taxpayer needs to submit a return. Taxpayers who meet all of the following criteria need not submit a return: Their total employment income for the year before tax is not more than R500,000;
They only receive employment income from one employer for the full tax year;
They have no other form of income such as car allowance, business income, and rental income, taxable interest or income from another job;
They don’t have any additional allowable tax related deductions to claim such as medical expenses, retirement annuity contributions and travel expenses. Taxpayers who are yet to file can download the SARS MobiApp from the Playstore or Appstore and easily perform the following functions among others: Register as a taxpayer and for SARS eFiling
