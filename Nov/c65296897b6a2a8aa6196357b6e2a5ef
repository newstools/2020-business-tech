Retailer Game has published the fourth and last in a series of deals as part of its month-long Black Friday 2020 sale. These deals are valid between 25 November – 01 December and include sales on a variety of electronic and home items. The retailer has offered Black Friday specials throughout November, with new specials becoming available each week. The retailer said that in a bid to allow more South Africans to shop its unbeatable Black Friday deals, while ensuring shopper and staff safety, it has taken the decision to extend its operating hours from 25 – 29 November. “As we approach pay day, we recognise that many South Africans will be looking to shop Black Friday deals between now and the end of the month,” said Andrew Stein, vice president of Game. “We are extending our operating hours both in the morning and the evening, to allow for shopping to take place before or after work.” Game stores across the country will open from 6am to 8pm on Friday 27 November; from 8am to 6pm on 28 November; and from 9am to 5pm on 29 November. The retailer said it has also secured additional stock on the most popular Black Friday deals. Consumers will be able to shop over 150 items at unbeatable prices – only valid until 29 November. “As a responsible retailer, we continue to do all we can to ensure that our stores are stocked and safe,” said Stein. “The Black Friday deals will also be made available from midnight on Tuesday 24 November online through the Game website.” Game’s final week of deals launched on 25 November, and includes deals on appliances, home goods, and electronics. It is also featuring a number of great tech deals. Samsung 75″ UHD Smart TV – R19,999 (R5,000 off)
