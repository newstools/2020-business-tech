FNB credit card customers have been left with declined transactions and zero balances due to a technical issue. When trying to make purchases or complete transactions with an FNB credit card, the process is declined and customers are met with a message stating that “outstanding documents are required to comply with FICA”. The issue is affecting FNB credit card customers across the country, with no way for clients to get in contact with the bank due to call centres being closed on Sundays. The Financial Intelligence Centre Act (FICA) requires financial institutions, such as FNB, to establish and verify the identities and residential addresses of their clients. This is done through ID documents and proof of residence in most cases. However, customers reporting the latest FNB credit card issued range from those who have just recently signed up to the back, and those who have been clients for decades. CEO of FNB Card, Chris Labuschagne, said that the bank is aware of the issue. “Our technical teams are working hard to urgently resolve the issue. We apologise to our customers for any inconvenience caused,” he said.  Read: FNB is making changes to online payment approvals
