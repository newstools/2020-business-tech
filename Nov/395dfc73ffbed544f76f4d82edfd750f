Several companies had stand out performances: iFood, an online food delivery portal in São Paulo, Brazil, grew revenues by 234% YoY with KPIs including order frequency and order value hitting record levels.
PayU GPO, a fintech company that provides payment technology to online merchants, grew revenues 48% as people used cashless payment methods.
Udemy, a US based open online course provider aimed at professional adults and students, grew enrolments more than 400%.
BYJU’S, an Indian based learning app and online tutoring firm, saw 180% growth in students on top of already high growth rates. In the Edtech space, Naspers said it stepped up its total investment to more than $1 billion and seven companies in this fast-growing sector. Looking ahead, Naspers said the current operating environment remains uncertain and the longer-term social and economic impact of Covid-19 is unclear. “The group is on a solid financial footing and the fundamentals of the underlying businesses are strong, with all well-positioned to build on the accelerating shift to online triggered by the pandemic.” “Management remains focused on value creation for shareholders through driving profitability and cash generation in the group’s more-established ecommerce businesses, while investing for growth in food delivery, classifieds transactions, credit, and edtech,” it said. On 30 October 2020, the group announced its intention for Prosus to acquire up to $5 billion of Prosus and Naspers shares. This will be implemented by the acquisition of up to $1.4 billion Prosus N ordinary shares and $3.6 billion Naspers N ordinary shares on the market.
