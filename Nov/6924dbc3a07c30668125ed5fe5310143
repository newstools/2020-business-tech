Home goods and small appliances Game is also re-introducing its ‘1 Cent Price Surprise’ campaign which will allow shoppers to get access to items for as little as it a cent. “How it works is that it gives all Game customers, online or in-store, the opportunity to save even more on randomly selected products by paying just 1 cent at checkout. “This offer will also only be valid during the period of 2 to 29 November – giving buyers even more reason to get excited for their deals this month,” Game said.
