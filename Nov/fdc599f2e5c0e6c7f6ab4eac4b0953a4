South African pharmaceutical company Aspen says that one of its subsidiaries has entered into an agreement with Johnson & Johnson for a Covid-19 vaccine candidate. Aspen said in a shareholder statement on Monday (2 November), that its subsidiary Pharmacare Limited – which trades as Aspen Pharmacare – has entered into a preliminary agreement with two pharmaceutical companies of Johnson & Johnson for the ‘technical transfer and proposed commercial manufacture of their Covid-19 vaccine candidate, Ad26.COV2-S’. “The vaccine candidate is currently undergoing clinical trials. Aspen Pharmacare will perform formulation, filling and secondary packaging of the vaccine for supply to Johnson & Johnson,” it said. “This agreement is still subject to the successful completion of the relevant technology transfer activities and finalisation of certain commercial manufacturing terms.” Aspen Pharmacare said it has agreed to provide the necessary capacity required for the manufacture of Johnson & Johnson’s Covid-19 vaccine candidate at its existing sterile facility in Port Elizabeth, South Africa. The group said it has invested in excess of R3 billion in the facility containing the high technology equipment and systems that will be used to manufacture state-of-the-art sterile drugs and vaccines, packaged into vials, ampoules and pre-filled syringes. “The production area where it is intended that the vaccine candidate will be manufactured has capacity to produce more than 300 million doses per annum,” it said. “The facility has accreditation from a range of international regulatory authorities and provides lifesaving medicines to both the domestic and international markets. It was part of the first flagship investments announced at the president’s inaugural South African investment conference.” Read: Officials warn of harder lockdown as Covid infections rise
