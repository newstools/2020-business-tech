Comair said that regional services will be reintroduced as it ramps up to full operations over the next few months. “With reservations for the British Airways’ flights open we’re now able to offer bookings on a considerably expanded schedule. “As well as giving customers the choice of booking on either of our airline brands and a greater range of competitive fares, they now also have the option of booking in business class,” said Glenn Orsmond, representing the Comair Rescue Consortium. The reintroduction of British Airways’ flights will also see the reopening of the group’s SLOW lounges. Initially, the domestic lounges at King Shaka International, Cape Town International and OR Tambo International will open. The other lounges will reopen as the flight schedule expands. Orsmond says that Comair will initially operate a fleet of fifteen aircraft across both airline brands gradually increasing as the remainder of the fleet returns to service over the next few months. Kulula has said that it will begin to ramp up operations in the coming weeks and gradually return aircraft to service from Mid January to June 2021. The airline will start with a reduced fleet and as the demand increases, aims to have a full flight schedule by June 2021. Read: Level 1 lockdown changes planned for travel in South Africa
