An arrest warrant has been issued for Ace Magashule, secretary-general of South Africa’s ruling African National Congress. Magashule is one of the top six officials of the governing party and is the ANC’s secretary-general. The Daily Maverick reported that Magashule is set to be arrested and charged over his alleged role in the Free State’s R255 million asbestos audit contract. It is understood that some of the charges relate to payments made to certain third parties with the proceeds of the contract, allegedly on Magashule’s instruction. Captain Linda Steyn of the Hawks confirmed the warrant of arrest to Newsroom Afrika as part of a serious corruption investigation in the Free State. “The (warrant of arrest) was only signed today by the department of public prosecutions and given back to the investigating officer to be served on Friday,” she said. “The investigation had to be complete before (an) arrest was made. The Hawks must complete the investigation first, and if there is enough evidence to convict such person, then a warrant of arrest will be issued.” Steyn said that the Hawks were confident that it has enough evidence for a conviction. “The corruption unit in the Free State has been working day and night on this issue and there is enough evidence at this stage to have a warrant of arrest issued,” she said. <span data-mce-type="bookmark" style="display: inline-block; width: 0px; overflow: hidden; line-height: 0;" class="mce_SELRES_start">﻿</span> Magashule told reporters on Tuesday that he was “not worried” by news reports that an arrest warrant had been issued for him, and said he had done nothing wrong.
