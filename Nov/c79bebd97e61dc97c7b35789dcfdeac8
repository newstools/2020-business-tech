Courier company Dawn Wing has partnered with GPS-tracking company What3words to ensure delivery to an exact location in South Africa. What3words is developing a global standard for communicating location, and have given a unique three-word address to every single 3×3 metre square of the country, making it easy to find and share any exact location. This makes it possible for anyone, anywhere to describe their precise address using just three words and discover them in four available South African languages including Afrikaans, Xhosa, IsiZulu and English “With this technology, it means we can pinpoint the recipient to within three metres and ensures accuracy, reduced delivery time, but also supports more accountability from the driver,” said Hilton Eachus, chief customer officer at DPD Laser, which trades as Dawn Wing. “If the driver can’t deliver the parcel it will not be because he cannot find the recipient, it can only be another difficulty, like a diversion or traffic, for example.” Eachus said it is important that anyone who requests a parcel delivery receives one, irrespective of where they live. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-447014 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-1024x576.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="473" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-1536x864.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-2048x1152.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Dawn-Wing-2-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> He said that business customers also want an express parcels company that can deliver on time and accurately, while it is important the company’s drivers are as efficient and safe as possible. The success of the tool has also impacted emergency services. Up until recently, thousands of people struggle to tell emergency services exactly where they are and how to find them. In areas without addresses, callers are often only able to provide vague descriptions or references to landmarks, which means emergency services spend vital minutes, and often hours, searching for those in need of urgent help. For this reason, Vodacom zero-rated the What3words ‘find me’ page, meaning no data is used for emergency services. “Our volumes have exploded over lockdown, so it has never been more important to be precise and punctual, ensuring great service to the rapidly growing e-commerce market. If your courier is using what3words, then you can expect both,” said Eachus. Read: Telkom partners with SABC to launch mobile streaming service
