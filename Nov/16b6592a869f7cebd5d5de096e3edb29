Deals on cars over Black Friday 2020 are set to match those seen in 2019, with a number of impressive discounts available, says AutoTrader. Data from the car website shows that the average price of a car offered on Black Friday has declined to R524,763, from R580,856 in 2019. George Mienie, AutoTrader chief executive said: “The national lockdown has meant that 2020 has been a challenging year for the industry and consumers alike. For instance, new car sales have declined by 32,5% on a year-to-date basis as at the end of October. “But 2020 hasn’t been without some silver linings – and Black Friday is undoubtedly one of those. There was some concern that, with the declining new car sales, there could be fewer trade-ins and thus less used car stock.” Mienie said that this has not materialised and stock is plentiful which means that there are very good deals this Black Friday. While discounts are offered across the board, Mienie said that the biggest savings can be seen on luxury models. Some of the best deals are outlined below.
