Agriculture, land reform and rural development minister Thoko Didiza has announced the introduction of a updated levy on olive suppliers in a bid to grow South Africa’s local olive industry. In a gazette published on Friday (2o November), Didza said that the levy is needed by SA Olive to: Fund research projects;
Technical information and technology transfer;
Quality control and certification;
Information and statistics;
Communication, consumer education and market development;
Transformation and training for the olive industry. A levy on table olives and olive oil was established September 2016. On Friday, however, the government gazetted regulations to impose new requirements on suppliers, including the introduction of a updated levy. Didiza upheld the levy on table olives and olive oil: 8 cents/kg on all table olives; and
40 cents/litre on all olive oil. “The measure will not be detrimental to the number of employment opportunities or fair labour practice and will support the statutory measures relating to registration and the rendering of returns applicable to olive products,” Didiza said. The minister said that the measure will be implemented and administered by SA Olive, a company established in terms of the Companies Act. In a series of other gazettes published alongside the new levy, Didiza also introduced additional registration, importation and processing rules for suppliers.
