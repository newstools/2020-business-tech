The Western Cape Government has issued an urgent hotspot alert for the Garden Route, due to the rapidly increasing number of Covid-19 cases in that area. This spike is mainly contributing to the notable growth of active cases in the Western Cape, the provincial government said on Tuesday (17 November). “Specifically, we are concerned about the increasing number of cases in George, Knysna and Bitou. George, which currently has 628 active cases, has the highest number of active cases in the province.” Over the last weekend, the following cases were reported; 160 new cases in George
145 new cases in Knysna/Bitou
41 new cases in Mossel Bay
7 new cases in Hessequa “Along with the increasing number of cases in the region, we are also seeing the number of hospitalisations increase,” the province said. “Our hospitals still have sufficient capacity to cope with the surge in cases, however, we must all be taking responsibility to ensure that we are able to contain the further spread of the virus.” The provincial government said that its hotspot team for the Garden Route has increased surveillance, through screening and testing. It said that it is also working closely with the municipalities, environmental health teams, and stakeholders in the region to manage and contain the spread. “This includes a concerted communications campaign in the area. We are also paying special attention to vulnerable groups, including old age homes. “We will only be able to bring this situation under control if everyone takes responsibility now. ” Read: Dlamini-Zuma faces court challenge over latest lockdown extension
