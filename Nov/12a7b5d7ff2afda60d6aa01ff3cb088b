Telkom has partnered with the South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) to launch a new streaming channel, TelkomONE. The mobile operator channel will house the public broadcaster’s free-to-air radio and TV channels. The new service will stream live SABC’s television channels 1, 2, Sport and Education as well as all 19 SABC radio stations under a five-year partnership. “We are excited about the opportunity to provide South Africans with free access to watch their favourite SABC content, online, when and wherever they want,” said Telkom’s group chief executive officer, Sipho Maseko. “TelkomONE will make it possible for subscribers to pause, go back into the programme guide (time-shift) and instantly watch a scheduled TV show they may have missed. Telkom is making digital TV functionality available to all.” The SABC will provide its content to Telkom on a non-exclusive basis. In exchange, the SABC will receive a carriage licence fee as well as share in the advertising revenue generated on the TelkomONE platform. Customers can browse the catalogue and register for free to access ‘on-the-house’ content that has a mixture of news, inspiration and entertainment channels (SABC audio and TV channels, Africa News, France 24, Hope Channel, SBN etc.) They can also or subscribe to AMP subscription packages that include music, short films, TV series plus the free content by default upon registration. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-446970" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Telkom-1.png" alt="" width="567" height="149" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Telkom-1.png 567w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Telkom-1-300x79.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 567px) 85vw, 567px" /> Read: Telkom ‘solidly’ third biggest mobile operator in South Africa
