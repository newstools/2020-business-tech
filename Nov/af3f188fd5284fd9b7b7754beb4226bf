PayProp has published its latest rental index, showing that for the second consecutive quarter, year-on-year (YoY) property rental price growth hit an all-time low in Q3 2020. This follows a general downward trend for the year, with May and September being the worst months, data from the property group shows. “Lacklustre growth continued even after most South Africans returned to work,” PayProp said. “Because so many households suffered a partial or total loss of income this year, many are worse off financially compared to the beginning of the year, when economic pressures were already in effect. “In the circumstances, affordability continues to be a major factor in persistent low rental growth. “With many short-term lets reallocated to the long-term rental market. To avoid standing empty while travel restrictions were in place, the market has essentially been flooded with supply, adding to existing downward pressure on rental growth.” This has been compounded by inflation which has rebounded after the hard lockdown and is now in the 3% range. As demand for goods is one of the main drivers of inflation, the restrictions on the purchase of goods during hard lockdown explain low inflation levels during April and May, PayProp said. PayProp said that most provinces followed the national trend, experiencing further downward pressure on rental growth.
