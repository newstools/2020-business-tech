South Africa’s top-selling SUV, the Toyota Fortuner has undergone a facelift, and with it updated pricing over seven variants. The design team focused on retaining the characteristic profile of Fortuner while accentuating and refreshing the façade. At the front a larger, blacked-out grille with wave-like mesh pattern is accompanied by a silver-accented “skid-plate” underrun for a tougher, more integrated look, it said. “Re-profiled Bi-LED headlamps provide a sleeker look and these are further enhanced by prominent chrome accent strips that bridge the grille and headlamp assemblies.” The Japanese carmaker noted that the most significant changes are “under the skin” where new and revised engine components result in noticeable gains to output with sizeable cuts to fuel consumption. The more powerful 2.8 litre turbodiesel engine now produces 150 kW of power between 3,000-3,400 r/min and 500 Nm of torque between 1,600-2 ,800 r/min. 2.8 litre models are exclusively available with a six-speed automatic paddle-shift transmission. The 2.4 litre engine develops 110 kW of power at 3,400 r/min and 400 Nm of torque between 1,600-2 000 r/min, available in either a six-speed manual or automatic transmission. Toyota said that all models will benefit from a new variable-flow control (VFC) power-steering pump that improves fuel economy while delivering a more natural driving feel that varies depending on the driving conditions. A high level of assistance is offered at low speeds (parking manoeuvres) while offering lower levels of assistance at higher cruising speeds, in order to improve steering feel. A specific mode for low-range, off-road driving has also been included, it said. Safety and security Making its debut in Fortuner is the Toyota Safety Sense (TSS) safety system. TSS integrates a pre-collision system, lane departure alert, adaptive cruise control and road sign recognition – to offer drivers additional peace of mind, Toyota said. “TSS joins the existing array of airbags, ISOFIX, seatbelt pre-tensioners and a full suite of active safety aids (ABS, EBD, brake assist, VSC, trailer sway control, traction control). As before, 4×4 models also include Downhill Assist Control (DAC). “A comprehensive anti-theft system, speed-dependent auto-door lock function and keyless entry is included across the board,” Toyota said. <img class="size-full wp-image-447328 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner4-e1604994634952.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-447330 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner5-e1604994664202.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-447334" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner6-e1604994701841.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> <img class="size-full wp-image-447378 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner0.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner0.jpg 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner0-300x180.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner0-1024x614.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Fortuner0-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Toyota Connect All models are also equipped with the Toyota Connect telematics system which includes an in-car WiFi hotspot and complimentary 15 GB data. “Once linked to their profile, customers can manage their vehicle via the MyToyota App, said Toyota. “This intuitive app allows on-demand service bookings, vehicle information and history, tracking data as well as Toyota Connect data recharge services and much more – latterly even including the ability to renew your vehicle license online.” Infotainment The Fortuner also features a new 8-inch infotainment system with Apple CarPlay and Android Auto functionality. This allows users to mirror applications off their mobile phone – for seamless connectivity. Navigation applications such as Google Maps and Waze are natively included and occupants can also access their music libraries and streaming accounts via apps like Apple Music, JOOX, Spotify and SoundCloud. Wireless telephony is supported via Bluetooth with a USB input for additional media options. The 2.8 GD-6 models (mid and VX) are also equipped with embedded Audio Visual Navigation (AVN). Pricing All Fortuner models come with a 3-year/100 000 km warranty. A 9-services/90 000 km service plan is standard on all models – service intervals of 10,000 km or 12-months. Customers can also purchase extended service plans and warranty packages via their Toyota dealer. The SUV sports an all-new front bumper and grille, and comes in seven variants priced from R566,800, with the top of the range priced from R790,500. Exterior Colours A total of seven exterior colours are on offer, with Oxide Bronze joining the colour palette (replacing Avant Garde Bronze).
