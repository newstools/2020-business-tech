Video on demand service Showmax has launched Showmax Free, an ad-supported streaming service that offers a selection of local and international series, movies and sports highlights for free. The service is offered via the Showmax site or mobile app, and does not require sign-up or any details to be provided. It does not give viewers access to the full Showmax library, but lets users stream selected shows, with ads and has limited functionality. Unlike the Showmax 14-day free trial – which offers full functionality for the trial period before incurring subscription costs – the free service can be used indefinitely, Showmax said. “Downloads aren’t available but you can watch online anytime, on any screen. No sign up or billing details required,” it said. In terms of content, Showmax said the free catalogue contains a collection of hand-picked shows, including “early seasons of much-loved favourites”, as well as selected local and international series and movies. Showmax said that it will also offer sports highlights and “occasional live matches”. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-446556" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports.png" alt="" width="1822" height="860" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports.png 1822w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports-300x142.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports-1024x483.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports-768x363.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports-1536x725.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Showmax-Free-sports-1200x566.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> To activate free streaming on mobile: Download and install the latest version of the Showmax app;
