A ranking of the world’s best bars for 2020 has named three South African pubs as part of its extended top 100 list. The best bars list is compiled from the votes of more than 540 experts around the world, including drinks writers, bartenders, and cocktail aficionados. The voting was based on visits made from January 2019 through March 2020. Normally, the voting period encompasses 18 months, but the coronavirus pandemic, which forced most establishments to close after March, cut the assessment period short. Connaught, a stylish hotel lounge in London, was named as the best bar in the world. In an ironic twist, Connaught cannot properly celebrate its victory until 1 December, as a new four-week coronavirus lockdown takes effect in the UK, Bloomberg reports. Organiser Mark Sansom said that the decision to go ahead was made to give the industry a chance to “come together” and for guests to be assured that hospitality venues have worked hard to create safe and secure environments for them to visit after months of closures. “We were met with the overwhelming response that the industry needed something to talk about,” he said. “People are starting to go out again, and the message to consumers is that there are wonderful bars and they need to receive your support,” says Sansom, content editor for the World’s 50 Best Bars. “This isn’t a celebration, but a sober recognition for the bars that have managed to keep going in this difficult time.” The top 10 winners are as follows: South Africa <img class="size-full wp-image-446482 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin.png" alt="" width="1621" height="906" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin.png 1621w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin-300x168.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin-1024x572.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin-768x429.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin-1536x858.png 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/Sin-1200x671.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The list was dominated by European, Asian and American bars.
