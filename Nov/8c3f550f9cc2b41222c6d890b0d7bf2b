The decoder will be available at participating retail stores from next week for a recommended retail price of R2,499 for the standalone device and R3,699 including installation, DStv said. Some of the key features of the device include: Built-in Wi-Fi capabilities
Support for 4K Ultra HD and Dolby Atmos;
Redesigned interface;
A new DStv remote;
Integration of app-based streaming services including Showmax, and Netflix with more third-party streaming services to follow. The DStv Explora Ultra is wholly manufactured in South Africa, its enclosure is made of 100% recycled material, and packaging contains no single-use plastics. DStv said that customers will have the option to pay for their Netflix subscription in their monthly bill. The inclusion in the bill will also be available to DStv customers who want to become new Netflix subscribers. MultiChoice Group chief executive Calvo Mawela said that the partnership will allow customers to access the full suite of Netflix shows. “Shifting consumer preferences and technological advances drive changes in the way video entertainment services are provided and consumed. This partnership leads with an expanded choice of content, ease and convenience of subscription and payment with the DStv Explora Ultra as an enabler,” said Mawela.
