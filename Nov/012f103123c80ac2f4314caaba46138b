The group’s chief executive officer, Calvo Mawela, told MyBroadband that the company plans to launch this product through partner ISPs before the end of its financial year in March 2021. It will comprise a standalone DStv streaming service which will be bundled with fibre product at a discounted rate, meaning South Africans will no longer require a satellite connection to watch DStv. Instead, they will use the new DStv Explora Ultra or upcoming Streama set-top box, both of which can deliver the full DStv bouquet over an Internet connection. “The target is this financial year, but of course this year is one of those big years where we have a lot of things we are bringing out at the same stage, and I think we are trying to make sure that we stagger them nicely and that we give people an opportunity to understand these products,” Mawela said. “Our view is that we will still be able to roll it out within this financial year – we don’t see any hiccups there.” He said that MultiChoice is considering its partnerships with ISPs carefully, noting that they do not want to take something to market they are not satisfied with. “It is an area that is sort of new in a way to us. We’ve never really gone deeper into the Internet links,” he said. Read: DStv launches new rewards programme – including channel upgrades
