The app offers comprehensive turn-by-turn navigation powered by real-time traffic information and uses voice guidance to ensure that you remain safe while driving. The Petal Maps app supports many languages, with voice notifications available in English, French, Spanish, German, Italian, and Mandarin. To provide additional safety, you can zoom in and out of your map using air gestures – on supported phones, simply hold out your hand in front of the screen until the hand icon appears and then move your hand closer to the screen to zoom in. The Petal Maps app also gives you the ability to view your surroundings in 3D using smooth and seamless controls to pan, tilt, rotate, and zoom. For users who use public transport, Petal Maps offers detailed schedules, departure times, and arrival times for transportation systems like buses and trains – so that you can plan your full travel routes with ease.
