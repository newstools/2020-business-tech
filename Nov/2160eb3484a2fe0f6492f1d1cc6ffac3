Game is also re-introducing its ‘1 Cent Price Surprise’ campaign which will allow shoppers to get access to items for as little as it a cent. “How it works is that it gives all Game customers, online or in-store, the opportunity to save even more on randomly selected products by paying just 1 cent at checkout. “This offer will also only be valid during the period of 2 to 29 November – giving buyers even more reason to get excited for their deals this month,” Game said. Increased staffing levels both in-store and in the delivery leg of the business will ensure a convenient and positive experience for all customers, it said. Consumers can expect a delivery timeline of 10 – 14 days on all Black Friday orders, with the delivery fee being capped at R90. Large items added to an order including fridges and chest freezers will carry a R70 surcharge per item, per order.
