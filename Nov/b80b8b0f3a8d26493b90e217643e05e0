A number of local retailers have announced that they will hold early sales ahead of Black Friday, which falls on 27 November. This is primarily in response to the coronavirus pandemic, with retailers opting to offer deals over several weeks instead of risking an influx of shoppers on a single day, or over a weekend. In addition, a number of retailers have announced plans to offer extended online deals over the course of November and into Cyber Monday (30 November). The most notable early Black Friday deals are outlined below.
