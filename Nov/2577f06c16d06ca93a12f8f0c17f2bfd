Home loan provider, Standard Bank says that record low interest rates have helped to steady the South African residential property market. Standard Bank’s home loan book showed that 2020 property price growth is currently in the 2.2% to 2.6% range. Entry-level residential property median prices (R665,372) grew 2.5% year on year (y/y), while prices of medium-sized (R1,669,052) residential property prices grew 6.4% y/y in August and the median prices of small residential properties (R1,026,873) grew by 3.3% y/y. “We have seen pockets of our customers come back better and quicker than we thought. “We know that we are not out of the woods yet and that we need to be more conservative as consumers see themselves through the pandemic and the economic pressures of 2019, but overall consumers seem to be meeting their debt requirements regularly now that the economy has opened up,” said Steven Barker, head of home loans Standard Bank. The FNB House Price Index (HPI) showed annual house price growth flatlined in October, reaching 2.6% y/y (last month downwardly revised from 3.1%). Despite the mild reflation in recent months, the overall residential property price growth remains below inflation, as has been the case for most of the last decade, it said. Lower-priced properties are performing better, it said, with the bottom 20% of price distribution (values below R500,000, using FNB transaction data) averaging 11.4% y/y in 3Q20. On the opposite end the spectrum, the top 20% (>R1.9 million) averaged 0.7% y/y in the same period. The average time for a house on the market is 10.6 weeks, FNB said. Price growth by price quintile – Stronger growth in the lower end, despite labour market pressures <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451880" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fnb1-1.png" alt="" width="720" height="449" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fnb1-1.png 720w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/fnb1-1-300x187.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> “Despite the pandemic, industry-wide data shows bourgeoning home buying activity, with the volume of mortgage applications reaching multi-year highs. Year-to-date, applications volumes are approximately 9% above the same period in 2019. “However, approvals lag as lenders apply caution amid an uncertain economic outlook, only outpacing 2019 levels by approximately 1.5% year-to date,” FNB said. “In our view, activity is shored up by lower interest rates, attractive market pricing, lower transfer duties and the changing housing needs due to the pandemic. Furthermore, liquidity in the market has remained relatively intact,” the lender said. FNB said that approval rates are slowly recovering from their recent lows in May/June during the height of lockdown. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-451882" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FNB.png" alt="" width="605" height="400" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FNB.png 605w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/FNB-300x198.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Standard Bank said its home loan market share remains above 33% and as of June 2020 new loans disbursed decreased by 32% y/y while application volumes increased. However, with the opening of the Deeds Office registrations are catching up to last year figures, stabilising the recovery, and as of September year to date application volumes are up 23% y/y. The approval rate for July 2020 continued to increase from 54.19% to 55.89%. “The increase in approval rate is driven by an increase in affordability for customers following multiple reductions in the repo rate. “Many customers are  taking advantage of the low interest to pay down their arrears positions which we believe points to a shift in priorities as houses become more than just homes but also places of work as a result of Covifd-19,” said Barker adding that on average 54,88% of year to date buyers are first time buyers. Another interesting trend picked up by Standard Bank is the ongoing pressure on sectional title residential properties as property prices remained flat y/y with an overall cumulative decline of 4% since January 2020. Freehold residential property prices by comparison grew by 5.5% y/y in August following a peak in April at 9.7%. Prices have since gradually moderated but freehold property still posted a cumulative growth of 2.9% since January 2020. While all of this points to a stable residential property environment now Barker still advises caution moving forward.
