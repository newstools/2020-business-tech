Pick n Pay has launched a new delivery service in partnership with the Bottles app called Grocery Essentials. The partnership will see the retailer deliver essential groceries to customers directly from selected stores across the country, on the same day, the company said in a statement on Tuesday (7 April). Bottles is an on-demand alcohol delivery app that works in partnership with Pick n Pay. With the lockdown and the ban on alcohol sales, the app has been re-engineered to deliver groceries instead of alcohol. Pick n Pay said that the Grocery Essentials service was successfully piloted and it has already expanded to over 70 stores in Johannesburg, Pretoria, Cape Town and Durban. More stores are expected to be introduced across the country. “Grocery Essentials will offer customers an easy and more efficient way to stay safe and top up every-day basic essential items – from milk and bread to cooking oil and nappies,” said Jessica Knight, head of Online at Pick n Pay. Knight said that customers have the choice of over 1,500 products and can purchase up to 30 different products in one order (limits may apply per product). All products are categorised to help customers find the product they are looking for quickly. Categories range from fresh produce, bakery, pantry and frozen products to household items, toiletries and pet supplies. “Grocery Essentials orders are picked from local Pick n Pay stores. We have integrated the Bottles app with in-store availability to help us deliver on customers’ orders in full wherever possible,” she said. “Should the product become unavailable from the time of placing the order, the store will always try find a suitable replacement item. “We will continue to review products offered on the Grocery Essentials app based on customer feedback, and add the most popular items. We’ve already added over 600 new products since our pilot last week. We want to make this as convenient for customers as possible.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-388169 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-1024x1024.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="840" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-1024x1024.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-300x300.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-150x150.jpg 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-768x768.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-1536x1536.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Pick-n-Pay-1200x1200.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Pick n Pay said that customers will be able to place orders Monday to Saturday between 08h00 and 15h00, and on Sunday between 08h00 and 13h00. Items will be delivered until 19hoo (Monday – Saturday) and 17h00 on Sunday. Public holiday delivery times may vary and will be confirmed on the Bottles app. Pick n Pay said that Delivery costs R45.00 and there is a service fee of R15.00. All deliveries will be contactless. “The systems we have put in place will let us scale the service. We will roll it out to more stores so that we can serve more customers, both in metropolitan areas and towns,” said Knight.
