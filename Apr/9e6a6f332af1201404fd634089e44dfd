StatsSA has published the results of a new survey focusing on how the coronavirus pandemic is impacting the operations of South African businesses. A total of 707 businesses in the formal sector responded to the survey in the two-week period from 30 March to 13 April 2020, outlining the pandemic’s impact on turnover, trading, workforce, imports and exports, purchases, prices, and business survival. Asked how their workforce size might change over the two weeks following the reference period, 50.4% of respondents expected no change, while 36.8% expected their workforce size to decline. Businesses indicated that they have implemented a range of measures to cope with the impact of the pandemic on their workforce, including decreasing working hours (28.3% of respondents) and laying off staff in the short term (19.6% of respondents). Only about one in four businesses indicated that they had not taken any measures yet. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-391353 size-large" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-1024x705.jpg" alt="" width="840" height="578" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-1024x705.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-300x207.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-768x529.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-1536x1058.jpg 1536w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-2048x1410.jpg 2048w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Stats-SA-1-1200x826.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> More than four in ten businesses feel that they cannot continue to operate.
