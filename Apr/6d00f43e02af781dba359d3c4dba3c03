Woolworths has a launched new contactless drive-through service, allowing shoppers to order online and collect without leaving their car. The group said that its first trial of the service was officially held at its Durbanville Food Store over the Easter weekend. “During these last few weeks, we have been focused on putting in place all the necessary precautions to safeguard the wellbeing of our customers and employees during the Covid-19 pandemic,” said Liz Hillock, head of Online and Mobile at Woolworths. “We have seen an unprecedented increase in demand for our online offering during this crisis. Since the start of the lockdown we’ve increased our capacity by over 50% but demand remains sky-high.” “As an example, for the Easter period, we opened up almost 2,000 additional delivery slots which were taken up in a matter of hours.” Hilock said that the new drive-through service has been integrated into the Woolworths website. This means that the the correct catalogue is shown for the correct store, all pricing and discounts apply, and payment is processed safely online with zero contact. “Customers simply arrive at our store during the chosen collection window, and our assistants will greet you at the allocated Click & Collect parking bays and bring your groceries to your boot,” she said. Hillock said that the group aims to roll out trial Click and Collect services to a further 14 stores in the coming days across South Africa. “As we roll out and refine our processes, we will open up more slots and capacity for the service,” she said. The Click & Collect trial service is set to launch in the following stores: Kyalami
