Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa (FMCSA) is adding a six-speed automatic transmission for the Ambiente petrol derivative of its EcoSport, along with specification upgrades on the Trend and Titanium models. “The compact SUV category grew substantially with the maiden launch of the EcoSport in South Africa in 2013, and the model has dominated this class ever since,” said Doreen Mashinini, GM marketing at FMCSA. “Paired with the smooth-shifting six-speed automatic gearbox and the lively 91kW 1.5-litre three-cylinder petrol engine, the EcoSport Ambiente is a unique and compelling proposition that offers exceptional value for money,” Mashinini said. The EcoSport Trend and Titanium derivatives have also been fitted with the carmaker’s Collision Mitigation System – a pre-collision assist feature that alerts the driver of a potential collision with the vehicle ahead, pre-charges the brakes and, if necessary, applies maximum braking pressure once the driver presses the brake pedal. Cruise control with an adaptive speed limiter has now been added to the Trend models, while the Titanium gains front parking sensors to complement the rear sensors that are standard across the range. “An underbody protection shield on Trend and Titanium models makes the EcoSport more robust for less-than-perfect roads in combination with its 206mm ground clearance,” Ford said. With the addition of the new model, a total of seven EcoSport derivatives are available, starting off with the 1.5 Ambiente in five-speed manual or the new six-speed automatic version. A 1.5-litre TDCi turbodiesel model is also available in Ambiente trim, producing 74kW and 205Nm, linked to a six-speed manual gearbox. The 1.0 EcoBoost engine, which produces 92kW and 170Nm, powers the Trend and Titanium models, which can be specified with six-speed manual or automatic transmissions, Ford said.
