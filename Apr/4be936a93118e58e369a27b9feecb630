Minister of Transport Fikile Mbalula has expressed ‘grave concern’ about the growing number of motorists who are not following South Africa’s lockdown rules. Mbalula said that at the start of the second week of the lockdown, the following trends were recorded between Monday (6 April) and Wednesday (8 April): The number of cars stopped at roadblocks increased from 17,559 on Monday to 29,738 on Wednesday; E-hailing providers that failed to adhere to passenger limits for a vehicle licensed to carry four  passengers increased from 32 on Monday and peaked at 509 on Wednesday; Mini-bus taxis that failed to adhere to the passenger limit increased from 18 on Monday to 509 on Wednesday; Attempts by motorists to cross provincial boundaries increased from 125 on Monday to 196 on Wednesday. Gauteng had the highest number of motorists attempt provincial boundaries at 106.  ‘The conduct demonstrates a worrying trend which must be roundly condemned by both government and civil society,” Mbalula said. “Those who undermine efforts to arrest the spread of this pandemic must face the full might of the law and equally face condemnation by society as their behaviour places millions of lives at risk,” he said. Despite this, Mbalula said that he was pleased that the majority of motorists continue to follow the regulations. “Law enforcement will be intensified and authorities will not hesitate to ensure that the full might of the law is brought to bear on those who continue to break it.” Read: These are the second hand cars South Africans are buying right now – with price and mileage
