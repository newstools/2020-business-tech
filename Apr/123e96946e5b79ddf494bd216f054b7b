Advertising online is the most effective way for businesses to reach their audience, particularly during South Africa’s lockdown. This is thanks to employees working remotely and people staying in their homes – all of whom have their smartphones, laptops, and tablets by their side. In South Africa, there has been a huge increase in Internet traffic, and an equally large increase in the number of people reading news from trusted online publishers, during the nationwide lockdown. Narratiive – the official traffic measurement partner of the IAB – has seen a 32% increase in unique browsers and a 26% increase in page views for local news publishers, from January to March 2020. “Domestic publishers are incredibly vital in times of crisis, as they become an extremely trusted source of news. People, in general, move away from obtaining the latest facts… from social channels and instead rely on their local domestic publishers,” said Narratiive. With marketing budgets being aggressively slashed in cost-cutting efforts, domestic publishers should be supported now more than ever by advertisers, it concluded. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-387609" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/News.jpg" alt="News" width="640" height="249" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/News.jpg 916w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/News-300x117.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/News-768x298.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> BusinessTech, the biggest business news website in South Africa, has seen a huge surge in traffic as more business-savvy South Africans, executives, and entrepreneurs visit the site to learn more about the impact of the lockdown on the country. Narratiive traffic numbers for March 2020 show that BusinessTech received 5.59 million unique browsers and 15.33 million page views in March 2020. What the country will look like after the lockdown is equally important, which is why many businesses continue to promote themselves on BusinessTech. “BusinessTech continues lead the way when it comes to fast, accurate, and in-depth business news coverage,” said BusinessTech Editor Gareth Vorster. “With the economy, and business operations, greatly impacted by the lockdown and potentially any restrictions which follow, we will continue to provide valuable insights into the local market.” To find out more about advertising on BusinessTech, please contact BusinessTech Market Director Cara Muller on cara@mybroadband.co.za.
