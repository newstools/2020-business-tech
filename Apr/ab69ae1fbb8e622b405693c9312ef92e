Government says that it is ‘very concerned’ and ‘alarmed’ at US president Donald Trump’s announcement to cut funding to the World Health Organisation (WHO) with immediate effect, it said in a statement on Thursday (16 April). South Africa’s government said it is particularly alarmed that the decision was made amid a global health crisis that requires a full capacity World Health Organisation to provide support in combating the deadly Covid-19 pandemic. “It is alarming that this very regrettable decision is announced as this deadly virus strikes Africa and the poorest and most vulnerable states. “The WHO, as the lead UN Agency, is mandated to promote health and to ensure universal health coverage globally, is tasked to lead global efforts to suppress the transmission and stop the COVID-19 pandemic. “It is the sole global health agency, with the core focus on universal healthcare. As such, its efforts to coordinate a genuinely global response against this scourge should be recognized and supported.” It added that the escalation of coronavirus cases means that the WHO funding cut will have a significantly adverse impact on its programmes, and the world’s ability to fight and eliminate this pandemic. “This, at a time where now more than ever, the international community has to stand together and work in the spirit of human solidarity and cooperation with one another,” it said. “We believe that, more than ever before, the WHO deserves increased support from member states in particular to bolster its efforts to suppress transmission and stop the pandemic. “We are hopeful that the government of the United States will reconsider its decision and re-join the international community in fighting this pandemic.” Who funds the WHO? <img class="size-full wp-image-390037 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WHO.png" alt="" width="793" height="594" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WHO.png 793w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WHO-300x225.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/WHO-768x575.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> According to the World Economic Forum, the US is the biggest single donor to the Geneva-based WHO and contributed more than $400 million in 2019 – roughly 15% of the WHO’s annual budget. The second-largest funder is the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, which provides 9.8% of the WHO’s funds. The WHO launched an appeal in March for $675 million to help fight the coronavirus pandemic. It is reported to be planning a fresh appeal in coming days. Other countries are stepping up their own financial support for the organisation. The UK  has announced £200 million in new funding for international efforts to contain and combat the pandemic, including £65 million for the WHO. The WHO’s total budget for 2018–2019 was approved at $4.4 billion. There was no approved budget for humanitarian response plans and other appeals, as they are driven by events. In 2018, the WHO’s spending totalled $2.3 billion, down 4% from 2017. The organisation said its base programmes represented 60% of spending in 2018, while polio, emergencies and special programmes represented the remaining 40%.
