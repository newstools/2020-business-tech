Despite South Africa being the the middle of a 21-lockdown, consumers continue to go online in search  of used vehicles, particularly in the sub-R200,000 category, according to car marketplace, AutoTrader. Chief executive officer, George Mienie, said that searches for cars R200,000 and under continue to perform the best. “This is the largest segment – by far. We have recorded over two million searches in this price category this year alone,” he said. So which are South Africa’s most wanted cars in the sub-R200 000 price bracket? Mienie said that the most searched for car is currently the Volkswagen Polo. “This comes as no surprise; the Polo was also the top-selling used car in South Africa in 2019.” In number two position is the BMW 3 Series. “This German luxury car was the third most searched for vehicle in 2019 and the sixth most sold last year,” he said. The Volkswagen Golf is currently the third most searched for car in South Africa. “It was the fourth most searched for vehicle and the eighth-most sold vehicle in this country last year – so it’s a perennial favourite,” Mienie said. The fourth most searched for car at the moment is the Toyota Hilux. “It is the top-selling new vehicle in South Africa, and it was the most searched for model in the used vehicle market in South Africa in 2019,” he pointed out. In fifth spot at the moment, when it comes to the most searched for used car in the sub-R200 000 price category, is the Volkswagen Polo Pivo. “Like its Polo sibling, this Volkswagen product is popular in South Africa. It also sold the third-highest number of models in the six months ending December 2019,” Mienie said.
