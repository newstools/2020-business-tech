The Department of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs has published the latest Covid-19 regulations for level 4 lockdown. The move to level 4, from 1 May 2020, represents a general easing of the restrictions to allow more people to return to work and a marginal increase in movement. It allows for exercise under strict conditions, while more products can be sold, and more services will open up including some restaurants for delivery only. The regulations includes an update on government’s stance around the sale of cigarettes, which was previously allowed at level 4, but following feedback from various sectors, is prohibited. The easing of restrictions will allow the sale of children’s clothing, winter clothing and blankets back on the market, as well as stationary, office equipment, and hardware. This is the full list of items that can be sold at level 4: Food products, including non-alcoholic beverages and pet food;
The sale of hot cooked food, for home delivery only;
Toilet paper, sanitary pads, tampons and condoms;
Hand sanitiser, disinfectants, soap, alcohol for industrial use, household cleaning products, and personal protective equipment;
