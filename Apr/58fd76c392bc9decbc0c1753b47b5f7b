This follows worthy recurring earnings per share growth from PSG Group’s core investments, apart from weaker recurring earnings per share performance reported by Curro for its financial year ended 31 December 2019.

The lower dividend follows a decision by Capitec to not declare a final dividend for the year ended 29 February 2020. Capitec remains PSG Group’s largest investment and contributor to its recurring earnings. The bank reported a 19% increase in headline earnings per share for the year under review.

PSG noted that Curro, a provider of private school education, reported a 15% decline in recurring headline earnings per share for its financial year ended 31 December 2019, mainly as a result of increased finance costs associated with greenfield developments, increased bad debts with the consumer under pressure and higher than anticipated property rates and taxes. Zeder, an investor in the broad agribusiness and related industries, reported an 18% increase in recurring headline earnings per share for the year under review. Pursuant to the recent disposal of its entire investment in Pioneer Foods, Zeder declared a special dividend of R2.30 per share payable on 28 April 2020. PSG Group chief executive officer Piet Mouton said: “Although the results are commendable given the tough economic conditions it was achieved in, it is historic in nature and has almost no bearing on the immediate crisis-ridden future we are currently facing given the Covid-19 economic fallout. “A very strenuous time lies ahead and it is virtually impossible at this stage to quantify the impact of Covid-19 on our economy, businesses and our people – but it will be dire and correlated to the duration of the lockdown,” Mouton said.
