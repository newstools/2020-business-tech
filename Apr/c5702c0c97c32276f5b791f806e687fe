An initiative by Pick n Pay will allow hospital workers to shop for their essentials as quickly and as efficiently as possible. Hospital workers will be able to go to the front of the queue to enter the store or at the till point to pay for their shop. “We understand they work long and unusual hours so we wanted to offer something for all hospital workers serving our country during lockdown,” said John Bradshaw, retail executive: marketing at Pick n Pay. They need only show their identification as a hospital worker.” Bradshaw said they hope this initiative will help minimise the free time hospital workers have to spend shopping for needed essentials or give them the opportunity to complete their shop quickly so they can return to serving our country. Pick n Pay also as an exclusive shopping hour for customers over the age of 65 every Wednesday from 7 – 8am. Pick n Pay remains open during South Africa’s coronavirus lockdown, with customers able to shop in-store and online for groceries and essentials.
