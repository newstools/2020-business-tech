The United States government, through the US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), is committing a further R250 million to support South Africa’s response to the Covid-19 pandemic. This brings this total US government commitment to the Covid-19 response in South Africa to over R410 million, following previous pledges delivered over the last month. These initial CDC resources will be used for: Surveillance and lab support for the government of South Africa and other partners;
Expanding CDC operational support;
Support for infection prevention and control;
Emergency Operations Centres (EOCs);
Border health and vaccine preparedness; and
Special studies related to Covid-19 in South Africa to both improve the response in country and to inform best practices around the globe. “This latest injection of assistance is in addition to the approximately $8.4 million (nearly R160 million) in health assistance to support South Africa’s Covid-19 response already committed through the US Agency for International Development (USAID),” the US embassy said. USAID’s funding is supporting work in strategic information, risk communication, water and sanitation, infection prevention and control, supply chain strengthening for Covid-19 commodities, and public health messaging, it said. “Since 2009, American taxpayers have generously contributed globally more than $170 billion dollars (R3.2 trillion) in health and humanitarian assistance. In South Africa alone, through the President’s Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR), the United States has invested more than R80 billion over the course of our 17-year partnership with South Africa.” Read: US announces additional coronavirus financial support for South Africa
