Pick n Pay has launched a ‘collect direct’ email ordering service for over 174 of its franchise stores during the lockdown period. The group said that customers will be able to select from over 260 products, ranging from fresh produce to household items, and email their shopping list directly to their nearest participating Pick n Pay store for collection. The store will then communicate directly with the customer to confirm the order, and when it will be ready for collection. Pick n pay said that the collect direct email ordering service is available at selected stores in the Western Cape, Eastern Cape, Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Free State, Limpopo, Mpumalanga and North West. You can find a full list of the participating stores and more information about the ordering process here. John Bradshaw, retail executive: marketing at Pick n Pay, said that stores are working hard to provide alternatives and the best possible service to their customers during the coronavirus lockdown. “Many of our customers want to minimise their time in shops and this great innovation from our independent franchise owners will help them do just that,” he said. He added that some franchise stores have taken the initiative and created other tailored solutions for their customers. These include a ‘Drive-Thru’ where customers can park their car in a designated spot and have their groceries delivered and loaded directly into their car. Payment is via a sanitised mobile card machine. Read: Uber Eats is now delivering essentials during South Africa’s lockdown – how much it costs to order
