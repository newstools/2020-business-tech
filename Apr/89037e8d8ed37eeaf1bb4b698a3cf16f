As South Africa eases lockdown from Friday, 1 May, many fast food franchises around the country are preparing to reopen in a limited capacity. Lockdown level 4 will see the easing of the extremely tight restrictions placed on the country over the last five weeks, where all but non-essential workers have been forced to stay at home. This ‘hard lockdown’ not only placed restriction on movement, but also on the types of goods and services people could access, prohibiting the sale of alcohol and hot foods. Come Friday, however, some of these restrictions will fall away – of which, fast food for delivery will once again become available. Several of South Africa’s biggest fast food franchises are eager to get their deliveries out there, and many have already confirmed they will be opening for this purpose. While outlets have confirmed they will reopen, some have restrictions tied to them – such as only opening where deliveries through Uber Eats and Mr D Food will be available: Steers – confirmed it will be “lighting the fires” again soon, with three ways to get food delivered to you – via the Steers App, Mr D Food and Uber Eats.
Debonairs – confirmed it will return for no-contact delivery.
Rocomamas – confirmed it will be operating, though limited to areas where Uber Eats and Mr D Food have a footprint.
Wimpy – Wimpy said it will deliver “a selection of favourites” at selected restaurants.
Fishaways – confirmed it will be back with no contact deliveries.
Roman’s Pizza – confirmed it will be open for deliveries in selected areas.
Mochachos – confirmed that it will be delivering, but will provide further information on how and where.
Pizza Perfect – confirmed that it will be open for deliveries from Friday.
Pizza Hut – indicated that it will be open for deliveries.
Zebro’s – confirmed that some stores will be delivering on Friday, with the final list to still be confirmed.
Andiccio24 – confirmed it will be open for deliveries within a 5km radius of its stores. Orders can be placed online.
Simply Asia – confirmed that it will be operating.
Nando’s – confirmed that it will be operating. The following franchises have not yet said whether they will reopen – with KFC in particular saying that it will make a decision over “the next few days”, and Burger King acknowledging the level 4 guidelines, but holding off confirmation until a later time. KFC

Chicken Licken  The opening of any fast food outlet for delivery is still dependent on the final regulations, which are yet to be published. More restaurants are expected to confirm their position once the official regulations have been gazetted. While fast food or quick service outlets have been given a clear path to becoming economically active again, for more traditional restaurants and casual dining franchises, there may still be quite a wait. Restaurant pick-ups (where customers can collect their orders and restaurants aren’t dependent on delivery services) will only become available at level 2 – while going to sit down at a restaurant will only be available at level 1. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392267" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May.png" alt="" width="1200" height="601" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May-300x150.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May-1024x513.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May-768x385.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> And these levels will still be subject to social distancing restrictions, most notably on whatever limits will be placed on gatherings – meaning restaurants still won’t be able to operate at full capacity. Panaraottis has not responded to queries on whether it will be open or not with any definitive answer. The restaurant is part of the Spur group, which has indicated it would not make much business sense to open for production under any lockdown levels, as it would lead to major losses. However, each franchise is able to make its own decision on the matter. Other traditionally sit-down restaurants, like Doppio Zero, have indicated that they will trade at lockdown level 4, but will depend on the area.
