South Africa is set to enter a new phase of lockdown beginning next week Friday (1 May) – introducing a curfew while we will also see limited return of the workforce. The curfew will start at 20h00 and run until 05h00 each day, as the country begins to ease restrictions – through a tiered system – in a bid to get the economy back up and running. This comes after health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize confirmed that there are now 4,361 positive Covid-19 cases in South Africa. Mkhize also reported that the number of deaths from the coronavirus now stands at 86, up from the 79 deaths reported on Friday. Government on Saturday put in the public domain a draft framework for a Risk-Adjusted Strategy to bring different sectors of the economy under Level Four of the Lockdown back to work as announced by president Cyril Ramaphosa. Approximately 1.5 million additional South Africans will from 1 May return to work under the new terms. Trade, Industry and Commission minister Ebrahim Patel presented details contained in the new strategy, which is out for public comment and consultation, and can be found here. During the briefing, the minister detailed the classification of industries as part of the risk adjusted strategy on re-opening the economy. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-392267" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May.png" alt="" width="1200" height="601" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May-300x150.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May-1024x513.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Alert-levels-May-768x385.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> When the lockdown came into effect on 27 March, several sectors and industries were deemed essential and continued to function. These included all energy, water and sanitation, telecommunication infrastructure, health sector, food production, healthcare and hygiene products. All critical public sectors were also classified as such. Most financial sectors and mining, construction, communication, media, call centres and parts of the public sector have also been working during lockdown. Level 4 lockdown regulations Level 4 will see all agriculture, hunting, forestry, fishing and related services, including the export of agricultural products, permitted to operate. Automotive manufacturing, including components, will be scaling up in phases to 50% employment. Stationery production will be  scaling up in phases to 50% employment. Cement, other construction material, and hardware, will from next month also scale up in phases of up to 50% employment. All other manufacturing will scale up to 20% employment. In construction and related services, road and bridge projects, other public works civil engineering projects; and critical maintenance and repairs will commence. From next month, restaurants will be able to sell hot cooked food for home delivery. Sit down or pick-up are still not permitted. While the ban on the sale of alcohol will remain in level 4, stationery and educational books as well as tobacco product sales will commence. Personal ICT equipment, including computers, mobile telephones and other home office equipment, will be permitted in the relaxed regulations. The updated regulations will also lift a ban on ICT services for all private and business customers. Regarding transport, public rail, minibus taxi and bus services will resume at levels and on terms as will be set out in directions, based on the progressive increase in commuter numbers during the various phases. The mining sector will see open-cast mining scaled up to full employment. All other mining starting in batches, will scale up towards 50% employment. Patel said recycling of glass, paper and metal, including by informal recyclers, will be permitted at 50% capacity. Fitness enthusiasts will breathe a sigh of relief as they will from Friday be able exercise under certain restrictions yet to be announced. These include no training in groups and a ban remaining on recreational facilities and gyms. Patel reiterated that all Covid-19 health and safety protocols will still have to be followed at all times. This, he said, includes the observance of guidelines for social distancing, sanitation and hygiene, and use of appropriate personal protective equipment, like cloth face masks, as determined by the National Department of Health. During level 4, people will be permitted to travel to perform and acquire services only where such services cannot be provided from the safety of one’s home. New alert system In determining which sectors to open, Patel said government considered a new alert system to measure the degree of risk and an industrial classification system to indicate the economic activities that will commence either completely on in part. “The purpose of the new approach is to calibrate the level of openness with the level of risk. If we have high risk, there are fewer economic activities and social movement. If we have lower risk, the economy is able to expand and more movement becomes possible. It allows us to restart or increase as many economic activities as possible given the level of risk,” Patel said. He said the state had considered the expected impact on the sector for a continued full-on lockdown, how it affects the vulnerability of the sector and economic impact. “Third factor was contribution and economic linkage of every sector on the economy. GDP, number of jobs, multiplier effect on the broader economy, export earnings, supply chain linkages, industrial policy goals. The promotion of community wellbeing was the fourth factor,” he said. These factors, he said, have been applied to each of the different sectors. Moving forward under caution During the briefing on Saturday, Dr Anben Pillay, director general of the Department of Health, stressed the importance of social distancing in a post lockdown world. The government stressed that face masks would be mandatory. As such, Dr Pillay noted that hair salons and nail bars will remain closed as South Africa goes into curfew from 1 May. “All those services where there is direct contact, there is obviously a serious risk of transmission. So hairstylists, massages, nails, as well as those who are beauticians etc, there is very close contact, and personal contact with each other…and so the risk of transmission is much higher. “So clearly those services are prohibited for that reason,” he said.
