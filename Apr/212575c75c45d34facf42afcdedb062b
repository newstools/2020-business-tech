It’s a simplified business administration solution that helps you work towards complete company compliance in South Africa. Next, we’ll look at 5 questions that’ll help you understand why it’s important for you to tailor your start-up checklist according to your unique business. At the bottom of this page, you’ll find a general list of the paperwork most start-ups in South Africa need. If you use the Company Partners Legal File, you don’t need to worry about answering these questions now. They are all included in the Legal File tool and your answers will generate automatic suggestions for you. Nevertheless, let’s dive into why these questions are important to your new company checklist. If your business is already trading there are a few things you need to keep in mind. For example: Has your business reached the threshold for mandatory VAT registration or would you like to register voluntarily for VAT for specific tender opportunities?
If you’re already trading, you are also required to submit Annual Returns each year, to comply with CIPC’s company regulations.
It is also important to ensure you’re submitting your Tax return accurately to avoid any admin penalty fees SARS may implement for late or incorrect submissions. Specific industries, like the security, cleaning and construction industries need to adhere to specific South African laws. These legal requirements protect South African consumers from fly-by-night companies who aren’t up to certain standards, for example, safety standards. The industry which you choose to operate in will affect the suggested compliance documents for your new business. This question also ties in closely with your industry of trade. Although every Tender may have a different set of requirements, there’s usually a fixed list of must-haves. If it’s a public tender you usually need a Company Registration Number, a B-BBEE Affidavit / BEE Certificate, a Tax Clearance Certificate and a Letter of Good Standing. If you’re applying for a government contract, you also need CSD Registration. Your specific industry will then also add or deduct multiple documents to your compliance checklist. Company Partners can register most South African companies within 1 working day. There are some exemptions where it can take longer, and it may then be better to buy a shelf company where you can obtain your registration number immediately. Other extras are also included with certain Shelf Companies, for example: a Tax Verification Number, a Tax Clearance Certificate, COID registration, an Import / Export number etc. Other industry-specific registrations like NHBRC Registration may take a few weeks. Although it’s likely you’re a director, an employee and a shareholder in your own business, all these descriptions are legally very different. It’s important to issue a shareholder’s certificate; to establish who the directors of your business are and; to register as an employer at SARS as soon as anyone (including yourself) draws a monthly salary from the business. As an employer, you’re also required to register with COID and possibly UIF and SDL. Here is a quick list of the most common general and industry-specific documents most start-up companies in South Africa need. Keep in mind, some company documents are dependent on others; you may need one specific document in order to get another. The Legal File can be helpful for this purpose; it prioritises your list of must-have documents in order of priority. A business with no employees, trading locally, is different from a business that ships internationally and has one or more employees. Your compliance needs will also change as your business grows and you explore more opportunities and industries. Nevertheless, here’s an overview.
