The portfolio committee on Agriculture, Land and Rural Development has asked Agricultural minister Thoko Didiza to urgently intervene to stop the disruption of the agricultural value chain, which supplies South Africa and neighbouring countries with food. The committee said that it has received a number of complaints from both commercial and small-scale farmers regarding issues that affect their agricultural activities. This has included the illegality of livestock auctions (generally fewer than 50 people), access to spares and implements vital for farming activity, lack of support especially for small-scale farmers as offices are closed, and farmers being turned back at borders with fresh produce because of issues with the requisite permits. Commercial and small-scale farmers appealed to the minister, requesting a special dispensation for all in the agricultural value chain that ensures food security for the nation and allows food to reach markets and distribution hubs without any disruptions that may impact negatively, both in terms of additional costs and time, on the food reaching the markets. The committee said it is also concerned about South Africa’s ability to meet the requirements of international clients and markets, as these countries will go elsewhere if the country fails to supply them. “We call on the Department of Agriculture to improve its support to its mandated constituency, the commercial and small-scale farmers, in the best interests of the country and our nation. “The consequences of a prolonged disruption of the agricultural value chain is too grave to imagine and the impact on the nation will be of epic proportions.” Read: This map shows which areas in South Africa could face harsher lockdown restrictions
