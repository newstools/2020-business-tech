Pick n Pay has introduced new scan and pay technology at all till points nationwide to allow customers to go completely contactless when paying for their shop. The retailer said the new technology, which offers QR payments through Masterpass, builds on from it contactless tap & go card payment solution. Masterpass lets customers securely download a free digital wallet from any of the major South African banks to their mobile phone. Customers can then safely and simply pay for their purchase by scanning the QR code at the till from the Masterpass app and entering their bank PIN on their phone. This means that customers and cashiers don’t have to exchange a bank card and the payment pin pad is avoided. Customers will also be able to use Snapscan and Zapper, the retailer said. Richard van Rensburg, chief information officer at Pick n Pay, said that the number of customers making use of the contactless tap & go payment functionality over the past month has increased significantly as they limit unnecessary contact. “We wanted to offer more customers a convenient and easy solution to make contactless payments in our stores. We piloted the new scan & pay QR payments last week in selected stores, and customer feedback was very positive. We will complete our roll out to all our stores nationwide by the end of next week.” Read: You can now pay for groceries with your phone at Shoprite, Checkers
