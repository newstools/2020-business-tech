Government has announced the implementation of a risk-adjusted strategy in easing the nationwide lockdown and the country will move from its current position at level 5 to level 4. According to law firm Webber Wentzel, this means that all essential services will be able to continue operating together with the following additional sectors: Food retail stores will be permitted to sell their full line of products;
Agriculture;
Forestry;
Mining;
Financial and professional services;
Postal and telecommunications services;
Information Technology services and formal waste recycling services;
Transport restrictions will largely be lifted (subject to limitations on vehicle capacity and hygiene requirements).  No inter-provincial movement of people will be allowed except under exceptional circumstances. “However, this does not necessarily mean that employers and employees from the sectors listed above will be able to resume operations and return to work after the lockdown,” the firm said. “This will depend on the alert level assigned to each province. The alert level per province will be determined with reference to the rate of infection and the health system’s capacity to handle the virus at that particular point in time.” While the alert levels for each province are still to be announced, the government has said that it will take three main criteria into account: Risk of transmission;
Expected impact on the sector of a continued lockdown;
Value of the sector to the economy. The strategy also requires that the industries that return to work first should have an acceptably low transmission risk, be critical to the value of the economy and be under severe economic stress, Webber Wentzel said. “Therefore, for employers who have a multi-provincial footprint, they may find that they may only be able to operate in a certain province(s) depending on risk levels across the provinces. “With the above in mind, it is clear that there will be a gradual and phased approach to reopening economic activity and, after 1 May 2020, only certain categories of employers will be permitted to resume operations under specific conditions. “Government will shortly announce specific health and safety protocols that each employer will need to follow in order to protect employees.” Risk checklist In planning for a safe return to work, employers who are able to resume operations after 1 May must take the below considerations into account, Webber Wentzel said. The group noted that most employers have already established in-house Covid-19 risk management committees, and that it is these committees that should pay special attention to the considerations listed below. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-392587 size-full" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Checklist.png" alt="" width="837" height="880" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Checklist.png 837w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Checklist-285x300.png 285w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Checklist-768x807.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: This map shows which areas in South Africa could face harsher lockdown restrictions
