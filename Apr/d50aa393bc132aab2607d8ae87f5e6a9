Vodacom has cut data prices by up to 40% and says it will provide free data to access essential services through its zero-rated platform ConnectU, with immediate effect. Jorge Mendes, chief officer of Vodacom’s consumer business unit, said that the reductions will help support South Africans during the coronavirus lockdown, and that the group is committed to doing whatever it can to help customers stay connected. The new prices are as follows: <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-386817" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vodacom-data-prices.png" alt="" width="548" height="311" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vodacom-data-prices.png 548w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Vodacom-data-prices-300x170.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 548px) 85vw, 548px" /> “The latest data reductions will complement the discounted bundle offers that will also be made available to prepaid customers in more than 2,000 less affluent suburbs and villages around the country,” he said. For qualifying communities to access further discounted voice and data deals, they need to simply click on the scrolling ConnectU banner on the platform via connectu.vodacom.co.za. The announcement coincides with the launch of ConnectU – which is a zero-rated platform from Vodacom which also goes live today. Vodacom said it will provide content aimed at social development and offers a variety of essential services for free. “Learners and students enrolled in schools and universities can access relevant information for free, with no data costs,” it said. The ConnectU portal includes a search engine linked to open sources such as Wikipedia and Wiktionary as well as free access to job portals; free educational content on the e-School platform; free health and wellness information and free access to Facebook Flex, the low data alternative to Facebook that enables customers to stay socially connected. The group said that this latest announcement is part of Vodacom’s social contract with the public, and has been extensively discussed and agreed with the Competition Commission. “Today’s price cuts and free access to ConnectU will also assist South Africans during the national state of disaster while at the same time helping to drive greater digital inclusion,” Mendes said.
