South Africa will move to level 4 lockdown restrictions from 1 May 2020 as part of the country’s risk-based approach to dealing with the coronavirus. Minister of Co-operative Governance and Traditional Affairs, Dr Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, provided more detail on what level 4 restrictions will look like. The minister said that exercise will be allowed under level 4 regulations. You can cycle, you can run, and you can walk within your neighbourhood – within 5km, and not in a group. People will be permitted to conduct these activities between 06h00 – 09h00, the minister said. Between 20h00 and 05h00, people will need to stay at home under curfew, the minister said. The Minister said that 70,000 submissions were received on the regulations, over 800 from the business sector. The most popular submission was regarding exercise – with more than 22,000 submissions. Health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, said that South Africa’s prudent decision to institute a countrywide lockdown has circumvented an exponential explosion of cases of the worldwide Covid-19 pandemic within the borders of the country. Dr Mkhize, said while the lockdown will not spell the end of new infections, it has, however, significantly delayed the peak of the virus. This has bought the country precious time to beef up its response, and prepare health facilities for the management and treatment of those infected with Covid-19.
