South Africa will be able to make a proper scientific assessment of how the current coronavirus lockdown is serving the people of the country in a few days’ time, says president Cyril Ramaphosa. Speaking in an interview with the SABC, Ramaphosa indicated that it too early to declare whether the lockdown has been a success or should be extended. ”We are still doing an assessment on the effectiveness of the lockdown. In terms of compliance, we are finding that many of our people throughout the country are abiding the lockdown and its regulations. “There are pockets of people who are still getting on their lives as if there is no coronavirus and we want to say to those people that there is a serious disease, we must abide by the regulations that have been published by government.” Ramaphosa noted that while he was still waiting for the results on the effectiveness of the lockdown, it has definitely led to fewer infections. “What I can say (is that) if we had not locked down South Africa as we have, I can tell you without any shadow of a doubt that the infection rate in South Africa would have been a lot higher than what we have,” he said. The Department of Health confirmed that there are 1,749 coronavirus cases in South Africa as of Tuesday (7 April), with one more person succumbing to the virus. This is an increase of 63 cases from last reporting, while total deaths now at 13. Global coronavirus cases were at 1,431,973 on Wednesday morning, with total deaths sitting at 82,096. There have been 302,209 recoveries so far. Of the 1,047,668 active cases, 47,895 people are in serious or critical condition. The USA has become the epicentre of the viral outbreak, sitting with 400,540 cases – more than Spain and Italy combined. Over 12,800 people have died in the USA so far.
