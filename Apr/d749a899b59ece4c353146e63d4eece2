Prior to the start of South Africa’s coronavirus lockdown, the Department of Cooperative Governance and Traditional Affairs (CoGTA) gazetted a list of essential goods which may continue to be sold during the lockdown period, as well as the essential services which are exempt from most lockdown restrictions. On the goods side, the regulations state that all retail shops and shopping malls must be closed, except where these essential goods are sold. The regulations also state that stores will be prohibited from selling any other goods. Businesses face strict punishments for breaching these prohibitions including a fine, or imprisonment of up to six months. However, since this list of goods was gazetted nearly four weeks ago, government has introduced a number of new goods and revisions on what can and cannot be sold. Below, law firm Werksmans Attorneys provided an updated list of essential goods as of Tuesday (21 April) alongside the measures businesses will have to follow when selling them.

These certificates were sent via email to businesses that had already applied to the CIPC during the first phase of the lockdown. The new certificate will clearly state it is valid from 17 April 2020. Old certificates must be discarded. The new certificates will be available to be displayed from start of business on Monday (20 April 2020). The DTI has also indicated that the registration portal is only for companies registered in terms of the Companies Act. Other essential service providers, such as healthcare professional, sole providers (which includes Spaza shops etc.) and small scale farmers will not have a certificate, but must still comply with the regulations – taking into account the amendments.
