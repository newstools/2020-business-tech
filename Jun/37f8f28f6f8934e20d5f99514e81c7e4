The Department of Home Affairs will offer more services under the country’s level 3 lockdown, but will require South Africans to make appointments ahead of time. The department reopened under level 4 of the country’s lockdown and currently offers: Issuance of uncollected Identity Documents;
Issuance of temporary identity certificates;
Registration of births and deaths;
Reissue of birth and death certificates;
Issuance of passports to those in export and cargo transport. From 1 June, the department said that it will now provide marriage services and receive requests for late registration of birth. “For marriages, couples are required to book an appointment, by calling their nearest Home Affairs office,” it said. “On the day of the marriage, couples are requested to visit our offices with only their witnesses to keep the numbers of people at our offices at a bare minimum. “An appointment is also required when applying for a late registration of birth (LRB), which refers to a birth registration application lodged after 30 days of such a birth.” The department said that people visiting its offices are requested to wear masks and to observe social distancing protocols inside and outside of the building. Home Affairs offices will continue opening Monday to Friday, from 08h30 to 15h30. “Refugee reception offices remain closed. However, permits issued lawfully, and expired during the lockdown, would be deemed to be valid until 31 July 2020,” it said. “No visa or permitting functions will be open in SA and at Missions abroad during level 3 lockdown.” Read: Here are the updated rules for South African schools – including return dates and new forms
