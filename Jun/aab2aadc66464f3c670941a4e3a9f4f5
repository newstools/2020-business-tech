The Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration (CCMA) has launched a free digital platform for users to refer conciliation and arbitration disputes and make enforcement and/or condonation applications. The platform, which went live on 8 June, is accessible via the CCMA website, the CCMA Facebook page and directly through the following web link. “By providing users with a means of referral that does not involve physical travel to CCMA offices, the digital referral and application platform aims to contribute to the minimisation of the further spread of the Covid-19 virus, improve efficiency and relieve Users of unnecessary travel and further administrative costs,” said CCMA director Cameron Morajane. The CCMA said that the following referral and application forms are currently available on the digital platform: The Labour Relations Act Form 7.11 – which is used to refer disputes to the CCMA for conciliation and con-arb hearings; The Labour Relations Act Form 7.13 – which is used to request an arbitration process where parties have not managed to resolve the dispute at conciliation; The Labour Relations Act Form 7.18 – which is used to have an arbitration award that has not been complied with by the employer, certified. This form also includes an instruction to the sheriff of the court to enforce the award as if it were an order of the Magistrates Court; Condonation application form for late referral of alleged unfair dismissal – for employees who have been dismissed and who have not met the prescribed time period (30 days from date of dismissal or from the date of the outcome of the appeal) within which the matter must be referred to the CCMA; Condonation application form for late referral of an alleged unfair labour practice or alleged unfair discrimination dispute – for employees who claim to have been subject to an unfair labour practice and who have not met the prescribed time period to refer an alleged unfair labour practice dispute (a referral that is lodged after the 90-day referral period) or alleged act of unfair discrimination. The CMMA said that the platform is subject to strict online security provisions and that it has put in place ‘maximum information security’.
