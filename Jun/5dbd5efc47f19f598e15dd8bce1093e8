This is despite listings in areas like Clifton, Camps Bay, Fresnaye and Bantry Bay climbing – up 200 new listings this year. Ross Levin, managing director for Seeff Atlantic Seaboard and City Bowl noted that during the boom period of 2016-2017, the market was doing about five sales per month in the R20 million-plus sector, with prices reaching R80 million to R120 million in Clifton. Last year’s highest price reached just R60 million in Fresnaye, while this year so far, just R34 million in Camps Bay, he said. “With no real price movement in the super prime sector, this is arguably one of the best periods for ‘bargain hunting’ that we have seen in the last decade,” Levin said, adding that that there are now many new listings not seen before while sellers are motivated to take lower offers. The realty group said that although it is still early days for the market under lockdown level 3, there are encouraging trends emerging in the luxury market, in particular a renewed interest from semigration buyers. Levin said that buyers that take a long-term view, could reap rewards when the market cycle ticks up again. Read: This bungalow on Clifton beach has just sold for R18 million
