With a significant number of businesses opting for contactless operations across South Africa in response to the Covid-19 crisis, Uber has launched Uber Cash to further promote contactless transactions across all its platforms. “While existing payment options will still be available including cash (for rides only), debit card and gift cards, this new feature offers a seamless way to make and further control payment on both Uber and Uber Eats,” the group said. “This method creates a payment account dedicated to both apps that can be preloaded with any amount, to be used on upcoming trips and orders. “The account can be topped-up via the user’s Ride account and used as and when needed on both Uber and Uber Eats apps, allowing the user to control the amount spent on the specific app, further helping them control their budget.” Uber said that top-ups are available and work similarly to that of an airtime increases.  Riders are able to top-up their balance via a debit/ credit card, an EFT or Barter for payment of use. Once the account has been loaded, all credit is non-expiry meaning that locals can use it whenever they see fit. Uber said that customers can access the new system through the following steps: Open your Uber app;
Go to Payments in your app menu to add funds to your Uber Cash balance;
Select the amount you want to top up and your preferred payment method;
Before requesting a ride or placing an order, change your payment method to Uber Cash;
Choose a destination/ add items to the basket;
