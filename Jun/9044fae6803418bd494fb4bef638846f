The South African Broadcasting Corporation (SABC) says it has issued a notice of possible redundancies following consultations with the public broadcaster’s key stakeholders. “The notice of redundancy will impact approximately 600 employees and these affected employees will be invited to make representations during a consultation process which will be facilitated by the Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration,” the broadcaster said in a statement on Thursday (18 June). “This is to ensure full transparency, accountability and impartiality in terms of the Labour Relations Act 66 of 1995.” The SABC said that organised labour, as well as representatives of the non-unionised employees, will be consulted ‘within a meaningful joint consensus-seeking process as mandated by Section 189 of the LRA’. The notice follows the launch of the SABC’s new ‘Target Operating Model’- a strategic renewal initiative aimed at transforming the corporation into ‘a financially sustainable, self-sufficient and fit-for-purpose public broadcaster’. “The SABC has a duty to ensure the continued viability of the corporation so that it may fulfill its public mandate and effectively serve the millions of South Africans who rely on it for education, information and entertainment,” it said.
