Group chief executive Shameel Joosub was paid a total salary of R43.4 million for the year, an increase of 13.4% from 2019. This comprised a basic salary of R12 million (up 7%), short term incentives of R11.7 million and a long-term incentive payout of R14.3 million. After tax, Joosub’s take-home pay totalled R23.9 million.

Vodacom announced in April that Joosub would donate a third of his salary for three months to the Solidarity Fund. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407861" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shameel-Joosub-salary-2020.png" alt="" width="1160" height="382" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shameel-Joosub-salary-2020.png 1160w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shameel-Joosub-salary-2020-300x99.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shameel-Joosub-salary-2020-1024x337.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Shameel-Joosub-salary-2020-768x253.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Group chief financial officer Till Streichert, who is stepping down from the company this year, received a salary paid out in pounds: £1.24 million (R26.7 million) – an increase of 11.5% from 2019.

The results came at a time when the country was still in a phased lockdown period to combat the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic, but reflected results to just the first week into the lockdown. Group operating profit climbed 13.2% to R27.7 billion, while headline earnings per share (HEPS) was up 8.9%, to R19.45. Total financial services customers climbed 12.8%, to 53.2 million, adding 6 million customers in the year, it said. South Africa revenue was up 2.2% to R52.7 billion, with data usage elasticity supporting recovery to growth in the second half. Vodacom declared a final dividend of 405 cents per share. Joosub said at the time that the results reflected a year of strong growth for the company. “The past year has been characterised by strong customer growth – we now connect 116 million customers across the group, including Safaricom – and the benefits of prudent portfolio diversification,” he said. At the end of May, Vodacom announced that it has simplified its structure following the recent expansion of its African portfolio, and accelerated growth ambitions on the continent, including financial and digital services. Vodacom South Africa as a result, will operate as a standalone company with its own managing director, Balesh Sharma. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407871" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vodacom.png" alt="" width="641" height="352" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vodacom.png 641w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Vodacom-300x165.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Read: Vodacom South Africa is now a standalone company with a new managing director
