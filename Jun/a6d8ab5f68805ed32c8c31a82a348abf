Globally, coronavirus cases topped 7.9 million on Sunday, while deaths have exceeded 432,000 and 4 million recoveries have been reported.  While the country’s coronavirus cases continue to increase, government currently has no plans to review its relaxed lockdown rules and does not plan to reintroduce a countrywide ban on the sale of alcohol at this point in time. Speaking to the Sunday Times, Minister in the presidency Jackson said that the cabinet had not discussed reversing the relaxation of regulations. “The decision of cabinet stands. It is not up for reviewal … we have not discussed the reviewal of those measures. Not at all. “All we have said is let’s have discussions with the experts and see how they look at measures that we have taken so that we are advised,” He added that the National Coronavirus Command Council (NCCC) will receive a briefing from the health ministerial advisory council (MAC) on Tuesday to get an understanding of how the relaxed regulations have impacted the health system. It is also expected to advise on the impact of the tobacco ban and whether the government can open the economy further — including allowing seated patrons at restaurants, and hotels and B&Bs to operate.
