The enhanced verification rates and accuracy ensure a pleasant, touch-free experience for users – a vast improvement over swiping ID cards or fingerprint scans. Furthermore, MinMoe Face Recognition Terminals perform well in low- and even zero-light environments. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-404655" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png" alt="" width="640" height="320" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2.png 480w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/2-300x150.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Equipped with dual lenses – a visible light lens and an infrared lens – MinMoe Face Recognition Terminals will only grant access when both lenses detect the same person, as well as determine whether the face is actual, not an image. This anti-spoofing technology makes access control management much safer and prevents most attendance fraud. <img class="aligncenter wp-image-404659" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Touch-free.png" alt="" width="640" height="335" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Touch-free.png 1200w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Touch-free-300x157.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Touch-free-1024x536.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Touch-free-768x402.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Along with door linkage, MinMoe Face Recognition Terminals can be linked with NVRs for data recording and storage. They can also be linked with network cameras to allow clear video recording of the scene when any pre-set events are triggered. MinMoe products provide an abundance of third-party integration options for extensive compatibility, allowing quick and cost-effective connections between MinMoe Face Recognition Terminals and customers’ existing door control and attendance systems.
