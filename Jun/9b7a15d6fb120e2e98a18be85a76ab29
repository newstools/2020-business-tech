The minister announced 57 new deaths, taking the total up to 1,625, and a mortality rate of 2.1%, while recoveries increased to 42,063, which translates to a recovery rate of 55.1%. The department’s data (as of 15 June) shows that the majority of these deaths were reported in the 50+ age group. 27% of deaths (422 people) were reported in the 60-69 age group, while 24.6% of deaths (386) were reported in the 50-59 age group. By comparison, less than a quarter (20.6%) of the country’s total reported deaths were people under the age of 50. Data from the Department of Health shows a more detailed view of how the country is affected by the virus, depending on their age. Data as of 15 June 2020. With older South Africans most at risk of the coronavirus, Dr Mkhize has called on young South Africans to ‘build a culture of change’ during the pandemic. He said, in coming days, the country will see a rise in infections: more people would be hospitalised, and many would lose their lives. Mkhize said, to deal with the virus, it was no longer about what government says, but that it was about each individual. He also said citizens needed to build a culture of ensuring that they wear masks, wash hands and maintain physical distance. “Since the advent of the pandemic on our shores, we have lost 123 fellow South Africans who were 39 years old or younger, with 29 of those under the age of 30,” he said. “It is imperative that we do not fall into despair as we combat Covid-19. We can never be complacent or found wanting. The Coronavirus has decimated some of the strongest health care systems and called on humanity to entirely reassess its way of living,” Mkhize said Covid-19 has changed the way things are done and has forced humanity to choose between life or external trappings. “It is possible to fight back. Like the youth of 1976, it takes consciousness, discipline, co-operation and courage to turn the tide against this invisible enemy. “We can turn the tide against this enemy. As a country we can maintain control over the Coronavirus,” he said. Read: Aspen spikes on news that ‘breakthrough’ coronavirus drug is made in South Africa
