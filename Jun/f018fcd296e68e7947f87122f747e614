Codehesion is South Africa’s leading smartphone app development company, specialising in Android and iOS development. Its strength is that is creates better smartphone apps at more affordable rates than other large software development companies. When Codehesion started operating, however, it needed to let the market know it was the best option for South African companies who wanted to develop their smartphone app. It also needed to ensure it stood out above its competitors, and did not get lost in the crowd. To achieve this, Codehesion launched an online-only marketing campaign – which included a strong presence on BusinessTech. The two main marketing elements Codehesion used on BusinessTech were sponsored articles and Facebook retargeting. Codehesion regularly published sponsored articles on BusinessTech detailing what services it offered, why it was a superior option to its competitors, and how it could take care of all a company’s smartphone app development needs. These articles were published on the BusinessTech homepage, included in the daily email newsletter, and posted to BusinessTech’s Facebook, Twitter, and LinkedIn pages. Facebook retargeting was then used to serve Codehesion adverts on Facebook to people who had read Codehesion’s articles on BusinessTech. This retargeting was very successful, as adverts were only serviced to people who had already shown an interest in Codehesion. This also ensured that Codehesion’s advertising spend was allocated efficiently. The result of the BusinessTech campaign was that over the past year 9,167 people visited the Codehesion website to find out more about the company and what it offers. Content marketing on BusinessTech also provided a large number of backlinks to the Codehesion website – which increased its SEO ranking and resulted in over 2,200 visits from organic Google search traffic. The campaign which ran on BusinessTech was so successful, that it delivered more users to the Codehesion website than competing news websites, direct traffic, and organic search.
