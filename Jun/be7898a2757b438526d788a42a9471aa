Toyota has updated South Africa’s best-selling SUV, the Fortuner, with a number of new features, tweaks to its design and engine capability. Toyota unveiled a mid-life upgrade for its seven-seater SUV in Thailand, “elevating its visual appeal while assembling multiple improvements to engine, driving and towing performance”. The vehicle is due in Australia and Thailand over the next few months, with no set date for South Africa as yet. Toyota noted that the most significant changes are “under the skin” where new and revised engine components result in noticeable gains to output with sizeable cuts to fuel consumption. New and uprated components have resulted in an even more ‘robust’ 2.8-litre turbo-diesel engine, enabling maximum power to rise to 150kW and torque to peak at 500Nm. While delivering impressive gains of 20kW and 50Nm, additional measures including improved cooling have enabled fuel consumption to be reduced across the board, particularly in city driving where the improvement is more than 17%, the carmaker said. Another significant customer benefit from the upgraded Fortuner is a 300kg increase in the maximum braked towing capacity to 3,100kg, it said. The updated Fortuner retains its familiar GX, GXL and Crusade equipment grades, each displaying a unique surround for the larger black grille, restyled bumpers with a “skid-plate design” underrun, more prominent foglamp bezels, and slimmer headlamps upgraded to LEDs. Crusade is equipped with a new LED taillight cluster. Inside, customer infotainment expectations are met through the adoption of a larger 8-inch display screen (was 7), and advanced features including enhanced voice activation. Satellite navigation and digital (DAB) radio is available with the GX and standard on the GXL and Crusade, Toyota said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404907" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Toyota-Fortuner1-e1591267674696.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="586" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404911" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Toyota-Fortuner3-e1591267656303.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="899" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404915" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Toyota-Fortuner5-e1591267707184.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="899" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404917" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Toyota-Fortuner6-e1591267726264.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="900" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404913" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Toyota-Fortuner4-e1591267691535.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="903" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-404919" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Toyota-Fortuner7-e1591267741705.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="899" /> Read: 3 major new driving changes planned for South Africa
