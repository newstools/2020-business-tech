They also have access to share portfolios previously reserved for high-net-worth private wealth clients in the US, advised by Goldman Sachs Asset Management. International investing is driven by the fundamental principle of not putting all your eggs in one basket, and according to Kenny Rabson, CEO of Discovery Invest, it’s now more relevant than ever. “If you’re committed to investing over the medium to long term, global investing offers South African investors three compelling benefits: geographical diversification, exposure to different currencies, and access to new opportunities.” <img class="aligncenter wp-image-345381 size-full" src="https://test.businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Kenny-Rabson-CEO-of-Discovery-Invest.jpg" alt="" width="640" height="350" /> Rabson describes the enhanced Discovery Global Endowment as a competitive medium- to long-term investment solution with the following features: Discovery Invest also launched an intuitive analysis tool that advisers can use to compare investment choices, and added smart verification for fast and safe digital onboarding. Plus, they’re building a global risk-profiling tool to help advisers tailor solutions for their clients’ specific goals.
