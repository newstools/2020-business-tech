The University of Cape Town Council has announced that students who drop courses between Tuesday (2 June) and Friday (5 June) will receive a 100% fee rebate. “This means that if students are thinking about dropping a course to ensure they have a manageable workload (after consultation with their course convenors) they can make that decision without having to take into account the financial constraints about that decision,” said UCT deputy vice-chancellor Professor Lis Lange. The announcement comes as the university continues to grapple with the impact of the coronavirus. Earlier this week, UCT said that it will not consider National Benchmark Tests (NBTs) as a requirement for undergraduate admission to the university in 2021. “Given the impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on the NBT testing programme, the NBTs will not be part of the admission criteria for admission to UCT in 2021,” the university said. “As a result, UCT is considering amendments to the current criteria and expects this to be finalised soon. “Prospective applicants are advised to submit their study applications without delay and to make sure that they submit their Grade 11 final school results to be considered for an early conditional offer of admission,” it said.
