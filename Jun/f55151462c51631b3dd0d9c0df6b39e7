Cars.co.za, in partnership with data analytics company Lightstone, has published its latest vehicle ownership satisfaction survey. The survey looked at the purchasing, servicing and overall ownership experiences of car owners who bought their vehicles from new and through franchised dealers. Over the past five years almost 30,000 car owners have completed the survey, with more than 10,000 respondents recorded in 2019. For the purposes of analysis – and to achieve representative results – Cars.co.za only included models for which at least 50 owners had answered the “likely to recommend” question. Vehicle owners were asked to indicate – based on their overall ownership experience and using a 10-point rating scale – how likely they were to recommend the car that they’d bought new from a franchised dealer, to friends and family. With this scale, Cars.co.za regarded responses of 9 or 10 as “very likely to recommend” and consider these owners as “promoters”. Those owners who scored their experiences at 6 or lower are regarded as less likely or unlikely to recommend their vehicles, so they are considered as “detractors”. By deducting the percentage of detractors from the percentage of promoters we derive at a Net Promoter Score (NPS). Based on this scoring the top 10 passer cars are as follows: Mazda CX-5 – 89% <img class="size-full wp-image-298060 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mazda-cx-5.jpg" alt="" width="1280" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mazda-cx-5.jpg 1280w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mazda-cx-5-300x169.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mazda-cx-5-768x432.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mazda-cx-5-1024x576.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Mazda-cx-5-1200x675.jpg 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Mercedes-Benz C-Class – 87.5% <img class="size-full wp-image-268735 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/C-Class-e1535709669247.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> Audi A4 – 84.9% <img class="size-full wp-image-244727 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/AudiA4-e1526388610404.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="798" /> Mercedes-Benz GLC – 84.6% <img class="aligncenter wp-image-340349" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mercedes-Benz-glc.jpeg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mercedes-Benz-glc.jpeg 896w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mercedes-Benz-glc-300x169.jpeg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Mercedes-Benz-glc-768x432.jpeg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Mercedes-Benz A-Class – 84.6% <img class="size-full wp-image-357603 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Mercedes-Benz-A-Class-sedan-e1574846546194.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="675" /> Volkswagen Tiguan – 84.5% <img class="aligncenter wp-image-365450" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TiguanSA.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="720" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TiguanSA.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TiguanSA-300x180.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/TiguanSA-768x461.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Hyundai Tucson – 82.9% <img class="aligncenter wp-image-244725" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tucson.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="719" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tucson.jpg 834w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tucson-300x180.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tucson-768x460.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Hyundai Grand i10 – 82.7% <img class="size-full wp-image-301770 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hyundai-i10-1.jpg" alt="" width="1059" height="675" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hyundai-i10-1.jpg 1059w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hyundai-i10-1-300x191.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hyundai-i10-1-768x490.jpg 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Hyundai-i10-1-1024x653.jpg 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> BMW 1 Series – 82.6% <img class="size-full wp-image-370452 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bmw1-series.jpg" alt="" width="1024" height="683" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bmw1-series.jpg 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bmw1-series-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/bmw1-series-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> Toyota Fortuner – 82.6% <img class="size-full wp-image-207591 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fortuner2.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="667" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fortuner2.jpg 1000w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fortuner2-300x200.jpg 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Fortuner2-768x512.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> The survey shows that the brand with the overall highest-rated salespeople in 2019 is Isuzu, with a score of 9.1 (out of 10). Toyota, Honda and Mazda all scored 9 out of 10, with Suzuki scoring 8.9. Ford, BMW and Nissan (all with scores rounded off to 8.9) followed closely thereafter. “The Mazda CX-5 has consistently done well in our Ownership Satisfaction Survey through the years,” said Cars.co.za consumer experience manager, Hannes Oosthuizen. “Ultimately, the people who know their cars best are the owners, so the correlation between the two projects means that we are awarding cars that are most likely to please/satisfy their owners.” Read: South Africa’s car market has changed as the lockdown eases
