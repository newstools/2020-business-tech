With almost all businesses open in South Africa, many employees have returned to offices, factories, and warehouses. The government has stated that during the COVID-19 pandemic, all places of work and work equipment must be disinfected before work begins, regularly during the day, and after work ends. To ensure companies can provide their employees with a safe work environment, Drycon Group has partnered with KemKlean to launch a sanitisation and decontamination service for offices and warehouses.

These chemicals kill viruses, bacteria, and fungi, and are effective against water-borne microorganisms and airborne pathogens. To ensure an entire workspace is decontaminated, Drycon Group uses high-temperature fogging equipment and specialised chemicals. This method is recommended as per WHO guidelines, and fogging will only take place when there are no employees in the section of the office or warehouse being treated. Importantly, Drycon Group said there are no health or environmental hazards with using the service. Additionally, their service does not leave residue on work surfaces or cause corrosion of equipment – including IT equipment – which makes it safe to use on a repeat basis. “There is no disruption to equipment or furniture set-ups in a office or warehouse, and there is no effect on computer equipment,” said Drycon Group. While South African companies are obligated to provide a safe work environment for employees, providing peace of mind for staff is equally important. By decontaminating and sanitising the workplace, employees will feel safer when returning to work.
