French telecommunications company Orange says that it is considering further expansion in Africa, including entry into new markets such as Nigeria and South Africa In an interview with Les Echos business newspaper, chief executive officer Stephane Richard said that a move could happen within months, Reuters reports. “It could make sense to be in economies such as Nigeria and South Africa,” Richard said. “If one considers there are things to do, the time frame I am considering is rather a few months than a few years.” He declined to comment on possible interest in the MTN group. Orange has previously had a physical presence in the country, primarily as a retailer and repairs outlet. In November 2016, the group said that the store will no longer be available in South Africa and handed off its warranty and return queries to a separate company. Orange SA provides telecommunications services to residential, professional, and large business customers. The company offers public fixed-line telephone, leased lines and data transmission, mobile telecommunications, cable television, Internet and wireless applications, and broadcasting services, as well as telecommunications equipment sales and rentals.
