Twitter has announced that it will roll out audio tweets to iOS users from Thursday (18 June). “So starting today, we’re testing a new feature that will add a more human touch to the way we use Twitter – your very own voice. “Tweeting with your voice is not too different from Tweeting with text. To start, open the Tweet composer and tap the new icon with wavelengths. You’ll see your profile photo with the record button at the bottom – tap this to record your voice,” the social networking group said. Twitter said that each voice Tweet captures up to 140 seconds of audio. “Once you reach the time limit for a Tweet, a new voice Tweet starts automatically to create a thread. Once you’re done, tap the Done button to end your recording and go back to the composer screen to Tweet.” <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408601" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Twitter.png" alt="" width="884" height="884" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Twitter.png 884w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Twitter-300x300.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Twitter-150x150.png 150w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Twitter-768x768.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" /> People will see your voice Tweet appear on their timeline alongside other Tweets. To listen, tap the image. “On iOS only, playback will start in a new window docked at the bottom of your timeline and you can listen as you scroll. You can also keep listening while doing other things on your phone or on the go,” the group said. Twitter said that creating voice Tweets will be available to a limited group of people on Twitter for iOS to start but in the coming weeks everyone on iOS should be able to Tweet with their voice. “Everyone will be able to see (hear) them and reply,” it said.
