South Africa has hit a number of concerning landmarks in its tracking of the spread of the coronavirus – including the largest daily jump in cases seen to-date, and two further provinces hitting over 10,000 cases. According to the latest figures published by the health department and health minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, as of 14 June 2020, the country has 70,038 confirmed cases of Covid-19. This reflects a daily jump of 4,302 new‬ cases from the 65,736 infections on Saturday when the country recorded 3,809 new cases. The minister announced 57 new deaths, to 1,480 total casualties, while recoveries increased to 38,531, which translates to a recovery rate of 55%. On the balance of cases which have an outcome (deaths and recoveries) the country has 30,027 active cases which are still ongoing. Of note are the increase in cases in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape, which have now surpassed the 10,000 infection mark – though active cases are lower, with Gauteng having 3,207 recoveries, and the Eastern Cape with 5,244 recoveries. This represents 7,957 and 4,783 active cases, respectively. Cases in the central Gauteng region, which includes Johannesburg, the largest city, and Pretoria, the capital, continue to surge, rising at the fastest pace among nine provinces, Bloomberg reported. The Western Cape, however, remains the hardest-hit province. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-407969" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-14-June.png" alt="" width="827" height="415" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-14-June.png 827w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-14-June-300x151.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-14-June-768x385.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Western Cape The Western Cape reports 42,539 Covid-19 cases – accounting for almost two-thirds (61%) of the country’s total cases.
