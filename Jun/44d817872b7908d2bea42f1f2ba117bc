Ford Motor Company of Southern Africa (FMCSA) says it is expanding its presence in the utility vehicle sector with the Figo Freestyle – a sub-B segment compact utility vehicle (CUV) based on the Figo hatchback. Doreen Mashinini, GM marketing at FMCSA, said that the new utility fulfils the growing demand from younger buyers for a vehicle that is more compact and affordable than the compact SUV offerings. Ford’s existing range of active lifestyle-oriented models includes its top-selling EcoSport, the Kuga and the Everest seven-seater SUV. “With bigger wheels, an increased ride height and integrated skid plates that enhance its capabilities on less-than-perfect roads, the Figo Freestyle is designed to meet the aspirations of these young and dynamic customers. It is a cool, connected and very capable package,” she said. Two models are available in the Figo Freestyle line-up, starting off with the Trend and headlined by the comprehensively appointed Titanium series. Both models are powered by Ford’s eager 1.5-litre three-cylinder Ti-VCT engine used in the rest of the Figo range. As with the rest of the Figo line-up, the All-New Figo Freestyle is powered by Ford’s three-cylinder 1.5-litre petrol engine, producing 91kW of power at 6 300 r/min linked to a torque peak of 150Nm at 4 250 r/min. Drive is to the front wheels via a five-speed manual transmission. A key element of the Figo Freestyle’s design is the raised ride height of 190mm, which is 16mm higher than the standard Figo. “This enhances the Figo Freestyle’s all-round capabilities for active, outdoors-oriented customers, while integrated front and rear skid plates provide an enhanced level of underbody protection when driving on rougher road surfaces,” the group said. Roof rails are fitted as standard, it said. Figo Freestyle is available in six colour choices, including the new ‘Canyon Ridge’ that is unique to this model, along with Diamond white – both of which are solid paint finishes. Metallic paint options comprise Smoke Grey, Moondust Silver, Ruby Red and White Gold. Driving convenience is provided with the standard fitment of reverse parking sensors. “The Trend is equipped with Ford’s clever Device Dock which includes Bluetooth, USB and Aux connectivity and a handy receptacle to hold a smartphone,” Ford said. The Titanium series adds a reverse camera linked to the floating 6.5-inch colour display for the SYNC3 system, which incorporates Bluetooth and voice activation that enables phone and audio functions to be controlled through intuitive, conversational voice commands. Other features unique to the Titanium derivative include keyless push-start button, automatic climate control, an auto-dimming rear-view mirror, automatic headlamp activation and rain-sensing windscreen wipers. The standard safety and security package on the Trend model incorporates driver and passenger airbags, ABS brakes, remote central locking with drive-away locking function, electric windows all round, as well as a perimeter anti-theft alarm and engine immobiliser.
