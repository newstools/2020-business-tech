Sun International has published a business update detailing how the coronavirus pandemic has impacted its operations. The group noted that trading slowed significantly prior to lockdown and that all South African operations officially closed from 26 March 2020. With the announcement on 17 June that casinos, restaurants, hotels and resorts will be allowed to reopen, the group said it is now gearing up to resume operations. While the official regulations still need to be published, Sun International said that inter-provincial travel is currently still restricted, which will impact the opening of certain properties, including Sun City and the Wild Coast Sun. While this travel restriction may be changed at a later date, Sun International said that it expects further restrictions as part of its phased reopening. “We anticipate Advanced Alert level 3 regulations under the Disaster Management Act to be published incorporating restrictions relating to the resumption of trading of casinos, conference venues,restaurants and hotels,” it said.

Social distancing;
Switching off every second slot machine and having shields between slots;
