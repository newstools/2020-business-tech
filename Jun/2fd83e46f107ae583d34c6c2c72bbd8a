Telkom Business has launched a new app called Yep! to help the growth of small businesses in South Africa who have been severely hit by the Covid-19 pandemic. Yep! is a digital marketplace where customers can purchase from small, trusted businesses. “Think of Yep! as a ‘friend’ to small businesses, as it provides a scalable solution to help grow and enhance their reach,” said Lunga Siyo, chief executive officer of Telkom Business. “The Covid-19 pandemic has far-reaching effects, none of which paint a bright future for many businesses and even more so in South Africa where small to medium-sized enterprises form the backbone of the economy.” Through the app, users can locate businesses or services they require in their area, request quotes, directly book appointments from the app, view the store online, and review its ratings. Users can also create their own online store with their own unique branding, upload their list of services to find new customers, Telkom said. Yep! is available on Google Play and Apple’s app store. The app, Telkom said, will continuously evolve and will soon boast several feature upgrades, including: More service categories will be enabled on the platform.
Full fulfilment where customers can book appointment, service providers can complete invoicing and mark job completion.
Online delivery and payment integration. It will also include a bidding section where users can post a service requirement or bid for new business as per customers’ requirements and corporate partners, Telkom said. Read: Telkom earnings fall despite strong mobile growth
