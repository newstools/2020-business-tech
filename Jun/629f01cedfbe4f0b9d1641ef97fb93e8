The Department of Basic Education has published a new directive that provides further clarity on the new academic calendar for schools in South Africa. The directive makes a number of amendments to a directive published by the department on Friday (29 May), including provision for aftercare facilities as well as ‘ongoing teaching’. Notably, the directive also states that learners in Grades 1 and 2 will resume schooling on 6 July. However, the revised start-date calendar does not reflect the fact that the return of Grade 7 and 12 has been postponed until 8 June. The below table outlines the return dates for all grades as well as remedial schools. <img class="size-full wp-image-403871 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-1.png" alt="" width="513" height="179" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-1.png 513w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-1-300x105.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 513px) 85vw, 513px" /><img class="size-full wp-image-403873 aligncenter" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-2.png" alt="" width="503" height="582" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-2.png 503w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Table-2-259x300.png 259w" sizes="(max-width: 503px) 85vw, 503px" /> The directive states that schools may be permitted to deviate from the above phased-in return of grades provided that such school: Complies with the minimum health, safety and social distancing measures and requirements on Covid-19;
