The Bank illustrated the behavioural impact of eBucks Rewards by revealing that the majority (56%) of its customers are now spending 100% of their pharmacy spend at Clicks since the retailer became an eBucks partner in April 2020. Previously this behaviour was prevalent among only 27% of customers. CEO of FNB Retail, Raj Makanjee says, “We are cognisant that customers are facing financial pressure, therefore unchanged monthly account fees and several free transactions will provide relief to many. “The financial impact of Covid-19 has also highlighted some gaps in the way some customers manage their money so we will be giving customers even more value to improve their banking behaviour.” Read: This is what you will need to apply for a coronavirus business loan: FNB
