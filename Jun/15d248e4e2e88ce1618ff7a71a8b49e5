State-owned power utility Eskom has warned that power supply is expected to be tight ‘until the weekend’ following unplanned breakdowns at several power stations on Tuesday (23 June). “Eskom appeals to the public to reduce electricity consumption as the generation system is severely constrained. We have unexpectedly lost four large units to unplanned breakdowns, while the return to service of another two generation units have been delayed. “The breakdowns happened to a unit at Kendal, Majuba and Lethabo power stations. Furthermore, a unit at Duvha and Tutuka power stations, have not returned to service as expected. “A further Kendal unit was taken off due to technical difficulties and to address emissions,” it said. Eskom said it had 31,000MW available total capacity to meet demand on Tuesday. Spokesperson for the group, Sikonathi Mantshantsha, said that total demand reached 32,030 MW.
