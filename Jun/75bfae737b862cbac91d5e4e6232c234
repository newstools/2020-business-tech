South Africa suffered its deadliest 24-hour period on Thursday (4 June), as its Covid-19 death toll climbed by 56, to reach 848 casualties, health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize said. The country also reported a record jump in new Covid-19 cases – 3,267 – nearly 80% higher than its previous 24-hour total. As many as 54 new deaths were reported in the Western Cape, prompting a visit on Friday by president Cyril Ramaphosa on Friday to assess the provincial response to the Covid-19 pandemic. The Western Cape is currently the country’s epicentre accounting for nearly two-thirds of infections nationally.  Dr Mkhize said that recoveries to date are 21,31, which translates to a recovery rate of 52.24%. The biggest proportion of people dying of coronavirus have underlying conditions, the government has said, while its data shows that age is a big factor. More than 80% of recorded deaths in the country are among people aged 50 and older, while more than half of reported deaths have occurred in people aged 50 to 70.
