South Africa’s largest private medical insurer, Discovery on Monday (15 June), updated the market on its financial position amid the Covid-19 pandemic, showing a substantial decline in headline earnings. In a trading statement for the year ending June 2020, Discovery said that over the past four months, Covid-19 has caused significant disruption to lives and economies worldwide. As at 14 June 2020, total infections and deaths climbed to over 65,000 and 1,400 respectively in South Africa; 290,000 and 40,000 in the
United Kingdom; and two million and 110,000 in the US. “In addition to its health impacts, the pandemic has driven extreme market volatility, as evidenced by interest rates and equity market movements. “For insurers specifically, Covid-19 has created a uniquely-complex operating and economic environment, with pressure on new business, lapse rates, and potential future claims; and volatility in interest rates and investment returns,” it said. Headline earnings, the group said, will be affected by the significant rise in interest rates in South Africa due to Covid-19 and the ratings
downgrade, and the historically low rates in the UK. “Given basic and headline earnings include this effect, these measures are very difficult to predict with a reasonable degree of certainty, and could potentially result in a decline of those measures between 70% to 90% compared to the prior year,” it said. It said that Vitality Group recorded a temporary slow-down of insurance partner sales due to Covid-19 lockdowns. “The business is well diversified across geographies, with a significant part of its earnings being USD based, and revenue arrangements are a blend of fixed and performance-based fees.” The group stressed that new initiatives remain a key strategic focus, despite revenue growth expected to be more challenging in the period. Discovery said it remains confident about the potential of new initiatives having taken some strategic shifts to allow for the different market conditions over the next few periods.
