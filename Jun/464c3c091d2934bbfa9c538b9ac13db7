The continued global modernisation of business practices spans almost every field of the global economy. This is no different for banks and financial institutions, which continue to prioritise the modernisation of their payment systems to address key compliance issues, support new payment schemes, and take advantage of new technologies. Click here to sign up to Temenos and the IDC’s payments modernisation webinar. The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the pressure on banks to digitise their transaction processes across the board. This is why Temenos and the IDC are teaming up to run an exclusive webinar helping African banks to highlight and address the key issues with modernising their payment systems. While it is widely agreed that the modernisation of its payment capabilities is a necessity for any bank hoping to remain relevant, working out which elements to prioritise can be a challenge. This is why Temenos has highlighted seven themes that are key to the future success of banks in the modern digital payments ecosystem. These themes are essential to supporting growth, innovation, compliance, and success in the era of digital payments. Temenos’s Mick Fennell and the IDC’s Mark Walker will be expanding upon these points and contextualising them within an African context when they speak in an exclusive webinar on 24 June 2020. Fennell is the business line director of payments for Temenos, while Mark Walker is the associate VP of the IDC in sub-Saharan Africa – meaning both are experts with great insights to share. The speakers will also provide guidance on how banks should transform their cultures, processes, and platforms to meet the new challenges they are facing – which have been exacerbated by the COVID-19 pandemic. Fennell and Walker will also offer guidance to developing cost-effective propositions that support the long-term strategic ambitions of banks in Africa. Click here to sign up to the webinar.
