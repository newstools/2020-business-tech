South Africa reported an increase of 3,267 coronavirus cases on Thursday (4 June) – the largest daily increase reported to date. The country now has 40,792 confirmed cases of coronavirus with total deaths having climbed to 848 – a day-on-day increase of 56 more deaths. The Western Cape has reported the  highest number of cases (14,917) and total deaths in the province now stand at 651. The Eastern Cape has reported a total of 4,936 cases and 95 deaths, while Gauteng has reported 4,845 cases and 33 deaths. The rising number of cases in South Africa is not unexpected, but comes at a time when the country is opening up its economy and further easing restrictions on movement under lockdown level 3. While this runs counter to World Health Organisation recommendations that lockdowns only be eased once country’s show a decline in the number of new cases, health experts have said that the lockdown would provide no further benefit, and has effectively ‘flattened the curve’ in the country. Government has indicated that it will assess 52 districts across the country at 14-day intervals to determine which areas need interventions to slow down the spread of the virus. Hotspots identified so far (where there are more than 5 cases per 100,000) largely comprise the country’s biggest metros. Western Cape The Western Cape remains the Covid-19 epicentre in South Africa, with 27,006 cases – accounting for 66.2% of the country’s total cases. President Cyril Ramaphosa is set to visit the province on Friday (5 June) to assess the provincial response to the pandemic. Regionally, the City of Cape Town is still overwhelmingly the hardest hit by the outbreak, with the metro accounting for the majority of the cases in the province. The Western Cape’s data from 4 June shows the areas with the most cases.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-405099" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CapeTown.png" alt="" width="1297" height="716" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CapeTown.png 1297w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CapeTown-300x166.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CapeTown-1024x565.png 1024w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CapeTown-768x424.png 768w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/CapeTown-1200x662.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 1362px) 62vw, 840px" />   Gauteng As at 4 June 2020 Gauteng accounts for 4,567 or 11.8% of all Covid-19 cases in the country.
