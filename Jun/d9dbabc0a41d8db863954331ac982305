Health minister Dr Zweli Mkhize has announced that South Africa now has 73,533 confirmed cases of coronavirus. This is up by 3,495‬ cases from the 70,038 infections on Sunday when the country recorded a daily record of 4,302 new cases. The minister announced 88 new deaths, taking the total up to 1,568, and a mortality rate of 2.1%, while recoveries increased to 39,867, which translates to a recovery rate of 54.2%. A total of  1 148 933 tests have been conducted to date, of which 26,975  tests have been conducted over the past 24-hour period.  <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408035" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-15-June.png" alt="" width="831" height="415" srcset="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-15-June.png 831w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-15-June-300x150.png 300w, https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/SA-covid-15-June-768x384.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 709px) 85vw, (max-width: 909px) 67vw, (max-width: 984px) 61vw, (max-width: 1362px) 45vw, 600px" /> Globally, coronavirus cases topped 8 million on Monday, while deaths have exceeded 436,000 and 4.15 million recoveries have been reported. The global economy is in a new expansion cycle and output will return to pre-coronavirus crisis levels by the fourth quarter, according to Morgan Stanley economists, Bloomberg reported. “We have greater confidence in our call for a V-shaped recovery, given recent upside surprises in growth data and policy action,” economists led by Chetan Ahya wrote in a mid-year outlook research note on June 14. Desperation for a way to keep economies from collapsing under the weight of Covid-19 could mean settling for a vaccine that prevents people from getting really sick or dying but doesn’t stop them from catching the coronavirus, Bloomberg said. Although a knock-out blow against the virus is the ultimate goal, early vaccines may come with limitations on what they can deliver, according to Robin Shattock, an Imperial College London professor leading development of an experimental shot. “Is that protection against infection?” Shattock said. “Is it protection against illness? Is it protection against severe disease? It’s quite possible a vaccine that only protects against severe disease would be very useful.” As countries emerge warily from lockdowns, leaders are looking to a preventive shot as the route to return to pre-pandemic life. Fueled by billions of dollars in government investment, vaccines from little-known companies like China’s CanSino Biologics Inc and giants like Pfizer Inc and AstraZeneca Plc are in development. At least one of the fastest-moving experimental shots has already advanced into human trials after showing an impact on severe disease — but less so on infection – in animals. Experts say such a product would probably be widely used if approved, even if that’s as much as it contributes, until a more effective version comes to market. “Vaccines need to protect against disease, not necessarily infection,” said Dennis Burton, an immunologist and vaccine researcher at Scripps Research in La Jolla, California. Advanced level 3 lockdown Minister of Small Business and Development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni says that government is looking to open more sectors as part of a move to an ‘advanced level 3 lockdown’. Speaking in an interview with eNCA, Ntshavheni said that the move will be especially beneficial for small businesses such as hairdressers and restaurants. “Already, when the president announced the movement to level 3, he also announced what he called the advanced level 3, which will include sit-down restaurants and also the opening up of personal care services,” Ntshavheni said. She added that her department has already completed the development protocols but that there were still some businesses that were seen as problematic – especially tattoo parlours. “The protocols are ready – including the rules for sit-down restaurants, hair salons, massage and other personal care services. We are ready to open it up.” Read: South Africa is looking to move to ‘advanced level 3 lockdown’ – here’s what could change
