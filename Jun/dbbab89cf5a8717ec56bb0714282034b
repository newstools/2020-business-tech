German carmaker Volkswagen has added a fifth model to its SUV range in South Africa, the T-Roc, joining the T-Cross, Tiguan, Tiguan Allspace and the Touareg. The SUV market is growing rapidly in South Africa and from 2015 to 2019, it increased by 44%. International experts estimate that the compact SUV segment worldwide will almost double in size over the next decade. “It is for this reason that Volkswagen South Africa is introducing another attractive model in the compact SUV space, less than 12 months since the launch of the T-Cross, it said. In the local market, the T-Roc will be available in the following derivatives: 1.4 TSI 110kW Design, 2.0 TSI 140kW 4MOTION DSG Design and the 2.0 TSI 140kW 4MOTION DSG R-Line. The T-Roc will reportedly cost around R500,00 for the entry edition, and R600,000 for the top of the range version, with prices set to be revealed in August. Exterior design The T-Roc is the first Volkswagen SUV that will be available to order in two-tone paintwork with visually contrasting roof section. On the Design derivatives, customers have a choice of pure white, red and black on the roof and exterior mirror housings, the carmaker said. These roof and exterior mirror housings can be paired with various exterior colours, thus giving T-Roc customers 26 different colour options. The R-Line derivative will have 21 different colour options, VW said. The Design derivatives come standard with the 17-inch Mayfield alloy wheel and have two further options of an 18-inch Montego alloy wheel as well as an 18-inch Grange Hill alloy wheel. The R-Line derivative comes standard with the 19-inch Suzuka alloy wheel. The T-Roc is based on the modular transverse matrix (MQB) meaning that the T-Roc offers a Golf-like level of ride comfort; it is 80 millimetres longer than the T-Cross and 162 millimetres shorter than the Tiguan. When all five seats are occupied, luggage space is 445 litres. The backrests can also be folded down in a 60/40 split, yielding luggage capacity of up to 1,290 litres. Interior features “The interplay between the Active Info Display and the specific infotainment system creates a new, digital and interactive cockpit,” said VW. In addition to the standard limestone grey dashboard colour, it has a further three interior colours to choose from, whilst on the R-Line derivative, the interior dashboard colour is Caribou Grey. Digital offering The T-Roc will come standard with Composition Media radio and App-Connect. The Composition radio has an 8-inch colour touch screen with two USB ports easily located in the centre console of the vehicle. Passive safety features include Electronic Stability Control (ESC), Park Distance Control, LED Headlights, Light and Vision Package, Blind Spot Monitor and Fatigue Detection. The I.Q Drive technologies included in the T-Roc are Park Assist, Emergency Assist, Front Assist, Traffic Jam Assist, Adaptive Cruise Control and Lane Assist. Optional features on all derivatives includes; the panoramic sunroof, electronic trailer hitch, smoker’s package, Discover Pro navigation system with a 9.2-inch screen, the Beats sound system and the Park Package. Customers have a choice of the 1.4 TSI 8-speed Tiptronic engine with a power output of 110kW at 5,000 – 6,000rpm and torque of 250Nm. The entry-level engine reaches 0 – 100km/h in 8.4 seconds, has a fuel consumption of 6.9l/100km and a top speed of 205km, VW said. The 2.0 TSI engine with 7-speed DSG and 4MOTION is the second engine in the range and has a power output of 140kW and torque of 320Nm. It takes just 7.2 seconds to go from 0 – 100km, with the top speed being 216km. The fuel consumption on this engine is 8.3l/100km, Volkswagen said. <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408427" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/T-Roc3-e1592404658541.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408435" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/T-Roc8-e1592404710191.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408433" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/T-Roc5-e1592404692236.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408421" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/T-Roc2-e1592404489738.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="746" /> <img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-408429" src="https://businesstech.co.za/news/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/T-Roc4-e1592404675252.jpg" alt="" width="1200" height="800" /> Read: The 10 cars that South African drivers recommend most
